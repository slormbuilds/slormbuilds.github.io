The synergy here is probably evident to any player on their first go of Mage, but it&rsquo;s the other synergies I was able to exploit that I&rsquo;m much more proud of.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c12 subtitle" id="h.mfnmwo9mv4qx"><span class="c9">Arcane Breach</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">The very next thing any player attempting to build an Arcane Bond build after discovering Time Manipulation will do is try and find the best skill to combine it with. You need a reliable way to apply Arcane Bond to as many targets as possible for clear speed, along with hopefully more ways to stack mana and Arcane Bond damage. I am probably not the first person to lock on to Arcane Breach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Permanent Bond&rdquo; node that refreshes Arcane Bond duration, only to be miserably disappointed that the devs wording in this game is very intentional and indeed, refreshing is not the same as applying. Thus it would seem that the hope for getting to abuse Arcane Breach&rsquo;s powerful Arcane Bond nodes (Double Slip Knot and ESPECIALLY Reap What You Sow) dies here. But after a lot of pouring over other options like Attunement Pulse and Arcane Missile and finding them unsatisfactory, I resolved to find a way to make Arcane Breach work.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c12 subtitle" id="h.3adazgw2rli0"><span class="c9">Wall of Omen (Devoted Scholar)</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Here is the big breakthrough that makes this build work. As I stated earlier the first problem any Arcane Bond build has to overcome is finding a way to apply the debuff, and despite the fact that it&rsquo;s not really all that powerful, the game is insanely cheap about giving you the option to apply it. Probably the best Arcane Bond build besides this one is something using Arcane Missiles &ldquo;Transcending Obliteration&rdquo; and the Obliteration type conversion for Chrono-Puncture, but this results in a lot of awkward mixed scaling as you need a lot of Pierce to make that work and likely scales worse because of the greater synergy with Arcane Breach. (More testing is needed though)<br><br>But if we want to use Arcane Breach and it&rsquo;s busted Arcane Bond nodes, while still being able to only equip two skills-- how do we apply Arcane Bond?! The answer is actually within the Devoted Scholar passive tree. The node </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;Polyvalent Caster&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;is an extremely unique one and as is the case in any ARPG, thus has the most potential to break things. &ldquo;If your last 2 Emblems are different, the next skill you cast will apply Arcane Bond to</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;every enemy hit</span><span class="c6">.&rdquo; Polyvalent Caster is the only way in the game to break what the devs intended and get ANY skill to apply Arcane Bond, including Arcane Breach. Success! Finally a reliable way to both use Arcane Breach + Chrono-Puncture, while also giving insanely mass AoE application to boot. Incredible synergy!<br></span></p><p class="c7 title" id="h.aj91na4vhl30"><span class="c8">Skill Trees</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Now let&rsquo;s take a look at each node and why they were selected. The most satisfying thing about this build is how you can see how few nodes don&rsquo;t provide something this build wants, despite how quirky it is compared to the traditional way the game is played.</span></p><p class="c12 subtitle" id="h.95dtej5zve27"><span class="c9">Chrono-Puncture</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 430.00px; height: 619.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 430.00px; height: 619.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I - Chrono-Manipulation:</span><span>&nbsp;Chrono-Manipulation was a lot better when it was bugged and just instantly regened all your mana, but it&rsquo;s still good. The important thing not to forget with Arcane Bond and Time Manip is that even though we stack a lot of Max Mana for our DPS output, it&rsquo;s not </span><span class="c16">exactly</span><span>&nbsp;what we scale off. Our damage isn&rsquo;t based on our Max Mana but rather how much mana we spend (i.e. how much mana we have at the time Time Manip procs). This means that actually having mana regen is just as important for our build as max mana, which makes this build unfortunately more persnickety than it already is. Thankfully Chrono-Manipulation along with many other nodes amongst the 3 trees we chose provide ample Mana Regen, and a little bit of Mana Leech on gear will make up the rest. If you find you don&rsquo;t need the Mana Regen for some reason and can always Chrono-Puncture at your maximum mana anyways, Critical Time + Chrono-Lock at Tier V of the tree is very good for single-target as well.</span><span class="c2"><br>II - Chrono-Speed: </span><span>This node compares very similarly to Chrono-Manamorphosis, and your choice will depend on how solid your mana regen is as well as how much attack speed vs. max mana you are getting from other sources. Attack speed falls off beyond a certain point especially on skills that already have a low CD like Chrono-Puncture, but this is a very efficient source of it when combined with the Tier V upgrade and frees up lines on your gear for more Max Mana%.</span><span class="c2"><br>III - Fury of the Chronomancer: </span><span>Weakest node on this tree, and yet still not entirely a waste. Single target is undoubtedly the biggest weakness of this build, considering we scale based on how many enemies we have a Breach under, but the multiplicative damage of this node helps to alleviate that somewhat. Nothing else is really worth taking. If you get the Legendary that gives you a 10% to turn your regular Chrono-Puncture casts into the Remnant version, your single-target will be completely fixed.</span><span class="c2"><br>IV - Time Manipulation: </span><span class="c6">What more can be said. Jump into the Timeless Prison and instantly spend as well as restore all of your mana. This is what makes the build work, letting you dump 100k+ mana in a single cast. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">V - Superior Chrono-Upgrade: </span><span class="c6">10 more stacks for your Tier II node of choice. Obviously more beneficial on Chrono-Speed than Chrono-Manamorphosis, but regardless it&rsquo;s still impactful. Other options are very tempting though, mainly for increasing single target damage. Chrono-Remnants gives you a 10% chance to deal your 10000% damage Puncture instead, which combined with Fury of the Chronomancer can really put the hurt on Elites. In my testing though it never seemed as major as it should. Chrono-Lock along with Critical Time at Tier I, assuming you&rsquo;ve got your mana regen sorted, can help to further scale your Elite single-target damage as things start to multiply out of control, but it still feels somewhat slow and underwhelming.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c12 subtitle" id="h.miflx3hr4g"><span class="c9">Arcane Breach</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 436.00px; height: 628.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 436.00px; height: 628.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I - Reap What You Sow: </span><span class="c6">The skill and node we bend over backwards to enable, this is where all of the build&rsquo;s scaling comes from. It&rsquo;s multiplicative nature is an obvious target for busted hijinks, and so we use it to its maximum potential here. The mana regen is welcome, but we&rsquo;re mostly interested in stacking as much max mana as we can by putting (multiple) breaches under packs of enemies, applying Arcane Bond and turning their own numbers against them to melt them. Basically the more enemies you get Breaches under, the more damage you&rsquo;ll deal. This will get you up to 100k+ mana pools and help you to pop packs at Wrath 10.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">II - Multi-Breaches:</span><span>&nbsp;At first I really wanted to take Peaceful Breach for even more CDR, but I learned that too much CDR is actually a </span><span class="c16">bad</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;thing in this build, at least when it comes to comfy spam-your-buttons-gameplay. (This has to do with Polyvalent Caster&rsquo;s condition on applying Arcane Bond) Anyways, having your Breach deal damage enables stuff like Leech, so it&rsquo;s a good thing at the end of the day. If you get enough CDR from other sources, you can take Multi-Breaches off entirely (easing your mana requirements) or experiment with swapping to Permanent Bond (doesn&rsquo;t do much) or even Eternal Breach, which actually is quite good if you&rsquo;re okay with the slower clear times for more damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">III - Double Slip Knot: </span><span class="c6">Ayyy, more Arcane Bond scaling. Just a great node for this type of build and another reason why Arcane Breach is worth working for. Other options are irrelevant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">IV - Ephemeral Rift:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Optional node. The massive increase to AoE is a huge boost to clear speed, but the 3 second duration can be quite a burden to bear as it reduces the maximum number of Breaches you can stack at a time, reducing your mana pool and thus DPS. The alternative then is using Tier II&rsquo;s Eternal Breach, which gives the same amount of AoE (Don&rsquo;t stack them, they become too big @_@) but without the duration penalty. On the other hand, waiting 2 seconds for your breaches to open is also quite a drag on your clear speed, not to mention your survivability as you will start leeching slower. All in all Ephemeral Rift is an extremely good node, but if you want to deal maximum damage-over-time at the cost of clear speed, Eternal Breach is also an option. All other nodes have 0 effect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">V - Gravitational Force: </span><span class="c6">Great node. Permanently pulls enemies away from you, making you basically immune to melee damage. (Although you still have to get pretty close to cast Chrono-Puncture) Groups up enemies so you can dedicate all your Breach spam to one massive pile of them and stack mana past the hundred thousands. Another reason I am so happy I found a way to make Arcane Breach apply Arcane Bond.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c12 subtitle" id="h.itoos7o81gb2"><span class="c9">Wall of Omen (Devoted Scholar)</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 441.00px; height: 625.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 441.00px; height: 625.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I - Endless Stocks: </span><span class="c6">The first of many good nodes from this tree, which makes me question why Arcane Bond is listed as the Arcane Commander&rsquo;s specialty instead, considering it has almost 0 applicable nodes aside from it&rsquo;s capstone. (which admittedly is quite good, but in reality is &ldquo;only&rdquo; a 25% damage increase) More free mana, what more can be said? The increased area of effect is also quite good but this is a sizable chunk of mana so we&rsquo;ll take it instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">II - Proximity Alert: </span><span>Two nodes in, already two nodes built for Arcane Bond! Nice! The movespeed Wall of Omen would be really nice, but 65% damage is hard to beat.<br></span><span class="c2">III - Magic Mutation: </span><span class="c6">It said it scaled off max mana so I took it. Obviously completely useless here as Mage can&rsquo;t scale thorns at all, so not sure what the devs were thinking, but at least it has some sort of effect for this build unlike the other two. If you&rsquo;re using Critical Time from Tier I of Chrono-Puncture, feel free to take the Time Stop nodes anywhere it seems appropriate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">IV - Immaterial Body: </span><span class="c6">Area Damage Reduction is a nice stat to have, even if I wish it was Projectile Damage Reduction instead. Slow Awakening is a trap since if we have low mana, we&rsquo;re doing almost 0 damage because of Time Manip anyways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5">V - Polyvalent Caster:</span><span>&nbsp;Yay, the namesake node. Let&rsquo;s review how it works, since the wording is a bit confusing: &ldquo;If your last 2 Emblems are different, the next skill you cast will apply Arcane Bond to</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;every enemy hit</span><span>.&rdquo; After a bug fix, this now means that your two most recent skills need to be of a different type, but the current skill you&rsquo;re casting can be of any type. Thus in order to proc this on every hit, you need to constantly alternate between Chrono-Puncture and Arcane Breach, which will require a lot of CDR on Arcane Breach. Thankfully, the Rank VIII upgrade is an incredibly powerful fix for that! <br> </span><span class="c2">VI - Wall of Termination: </span><span class="c6">Nothing else really does anything, but this is a super nice QoL node anyways as destroying enemy projectiles means you can drop the Wall of Omen and Gravitational Force-empowered Breaches and forget about anything in front of you for 15+ seconds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">VII - Easing Pain: </span><span>I am very sad about this node. We are quite squishy (and tragically melee range) so any form of mitigation is highly appreciated, but Mage has almost no defensive options even in this supposedly &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; specialization, apart from Easing Pain. Unfortunately, almost no damage in the current build of the game deals Elemental Damage, so it&rsquo;s quite a waste and we remain painfully squishy. At least Wrath 5 Skeleton Mage blasts won&rsquo;t wipe you off the face of the earth, potentially.<br></span><span class="c2">VIII - Emblematic Caster (Rank1 0): </span><span class="c6">After the bug fix, take this all the to Rank 10. This is an extremely powerful node and let&rsquo;s us cast Arcane Breach about as fast as we cast Chrono-Puncture, ensuring we&rsquo;re always applying Arcane Bond on all of our casts. Some free mana-cost reduction on Chrono-Puncture too!</span></p><p class="c7 title" id="h.txno98k8tah4"><span class="c8">Slormreaper</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Phew, we did it. Nearly at the end. Here is the best Slormreaper for this build:</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 452.00px; height: 702.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 452.00px; height: 702.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Very glad I had this drop early and decided to put in the work to level it even when no one knew what its Primordial effect was, because it turned out it&rsquo;s very powerful. While the Raw Damage is completely wasted here, the free Max Mana stats alone make this valuable pre-Primordial, and the Affliction proc helps out our single target a little bit more. But after becoming Primordial is when your damage really amps up. A ton of extra Elemental Damage added onto the Arcane Bonds proc damage is a massive DPS boost, and also helps to start scaling the Afflict debuff and Chrono-Puncture if you can find the legendary that lets you proc Remnants to improve your single-target DPS. On the other hand, as I stated at the beginning of this guide, our damage is actually not simply based on our max mana however, and is actually how much mana we have at the time of each Time Manip proc, so the Malediction is quite the cross to bear. That said, thanks to the wealth of synergizing mana regen options like Chrono-Manipulation stacking with Endless Stocks and Reap What You Sow, with a touch of Mana Leech, this should be sustainable. In any case Ferocious Affinity really makes you wish you could dual-wield it and Manabender at the same time!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c7 title" id="h.o4l8ktjzvgjn"><span class="c8">Ancestral Legacy</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 293.00px; height: 496.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 293.00px; height: 496.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Since we struggle with single-target, I like the Elemental Temper node shown here, for the 40% Ele Damage stim buff.

This necessitates greater investment into the Life Leech stat than normal which can be a bit of a pain.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">-Mana Leech DOES seem to work for some reason, or maybe its just that much easier to scale, so get around 3% or 5% of it based on your needs to take care of most of your mana problems. A bit more is never a bad thing though. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>-De-prioritize AoE past a certain point. Since enemies are slowly sucked into the center of the Gravational Force-empowered Breaches, you don&rsquo;t need TOO much AoE, and Ephemeral Rift or Eternal Breach take care of most of it for you. Still a great </span><span>stat</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;though.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>-**Even though attacking faster and thus proccing Time Manip more is a multiplicative DPS increase, attack speed falls off a certain point and you&rsquo;re already getting a lot of it from Chrono-Speed, so you won&rsquo;t want too much of this. Also, be mindful of Ferocious Affinity&rsquo;s Primordial Malediction and it&rsquo;s mana-burn effect because it really adds up at high attack speeds.<br><br></span><span class="c16">I can&rsquo;t stress this enough, you really need some defensive stats, so look for the usual good stuff like stacking HP%, Projectile Damage Reduction, Elite Damage Reduction, and of course All Damage Reduction</span><span class="c6">.</span></p><p class="c7 title" id="h.kfprrnxowvqk"><span class="c8">Legendaries</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I don&rsquo;t have many legendaries yet and didn&rsquo;t use any for the majority of my playtime, but I did luck into this one (Inextricable Waistguard)<br></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 369.00px; height: 347.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image9.png" style="width: 369.00px; height: 347.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span><br>and it&rsquo;s been really good for reducing oneshots.
