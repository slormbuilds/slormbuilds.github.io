# Introduction
Looking for a fancy and innovative build? Then this build is not what you are looking for.
This is an ice mage build to place Clones cc your enemies with freeze and chill effect,
so they can't reach you. While your Clones do all the work you can just chill... 

## Pros & Cons
### Pro
- Easy to play
- Damage scales with enemie HP
- Disabling enemies with cc like slowing movement and attack speed of enemies or silence
- Screen wide range of attack
- Playable for every currently available endgame mode
- Mage is just too flexible to play

### Con

- Very expensive build
- Need higher rune and affinity levels
- Can't directly control Clones to focus on certain enemies
- Uses 2 overpowered mechanics, so it might get nerfed soon
- Sometimes i got sleepy when i play this mage in the great forge

# Core mechanics
## Offense
The combination of Slormreaper Giant Staff of the Giant Slayer and legendary the Soul Eating Mantle is your
main damage source. Ray of Obliteration will trigger Soul Eating Mantle (at +11) for 3% max HP damage and apply
Enfeeble stacks on enemies hit (effect of Giant Slayer). Each Enfeeble stack increase incoming damage.
At 10 stacks and max affinity it's +350% damage. That means Ray of Obliteration triggers Soul Eating Mantle for
13.5% max HP damage four times per second (54% per second). Yeah killing EVERY kind of enemie in just 2 seconds.

## Defense
Mainly chill, freeze, silence and Air Conditioner Aura keeps the enemies from attacking. If attacks comes through
there is the shield build up with Thornbite Rune and Arcane Barrier to block projectiles.

## Slormreaper
Giant Staff of the Giant Slayer (normal version, max level, max affinity)

## Stats/Legendaries/Attributes/Ultimatum/Runes
### Stats
- Main focus is to get Ancestral Strike Chance and Critical Strike chance so you can trigger different effects (goal both 50%)
- A little bit elemental damage so burn actualy does some damage so it trigger Soul Eating Mantle too
- Tenacity, so you can escape all cc (goal 100%)
- Rebound and additional projectiles for Orb of the Arcane Master (if you want to play with Orb of the Arcane Master)
- Area Increased Size and Aura Increased Effect for Air Conditioner Aura

### Legendaries
#### Soul Eating Mantle (Cape)

![](/assets/posts/legendaries/cape/soul_mantle.png)
_Most important, not optional_

#### Ancient Frostfire Talisman (Amulet)

_Ice-Imbued Skills apply Burn to enemies hit_

### Optional but recommended
#### Faith of the Ancients (Helmet)

![](/assets/posts/legendaries/helmet/faith_of_the_ancients.png)
_It's for Orb fo the Arcane Master, because it costs a lot of mana and leach won't cover the costs_

#### Etheral Cloning Pads (Shoulder)

![](/assets/posts/legendaries/shoulder/cloning_pads.png)
_More projectiles for Orb fo the Arcane Master_

#### Wristlet of the Orb Master (Bracers)

![](/assets/posts/legendaries/bracer/wristlet_of_the_orb_master.png)
_again for Orb fo the Arcane Master_


## Attributes
- 10 Fury: for Critical Strike Chance
- 10 Zeal: for Ancestral Strike Chance

Rest of the points you can just put into what you like. In my build i have 45 Points into Zeal and Bravery for Heal and Movementspeed

## Ultimatum
I just chooses Area Increased Size for a little bit extra range for Air Conditioner Aura.
In an earlier version of the build i tried with Ancestral Strike Chance and it was enough to trigger most of the time.

## Runes
- Activation Rune of Hagan, because this build trigger a lot of Ancestral Strikes
- Thornbite Rune, because that is our safety shield in case attacks go through
- Enhancement Rune of Hagan, so we get more shield value

There is a cooldown on how fast Runes can be activated, thats why constrain reduction is a lost in shield value.

## Skills
### Ray of Obliteration
Ticks four times per second. Screems to be abused to trigger stuff

![](/assets/posts/Chill Mage/ray.png)

### Orb fo the Arcane Master
Use to attack between beams, so every enemie gets hit

![](/assets/posts/Chill Mage/orb.png)

### Arcane Breach
An alternative if you don't like Orb fo the Arcane Master and have more Area Increased Size

### Specialisation Arcane Commander
Arcane Barrier: Blocks projectiles, just in case for long range enemies

## Ancestral legacy
### Air Conditioner
![](/assets/posts/ancestral_legacy/air_conditioner.png)
_Reducing Enemie's Attack Speed around you_

### Elemental Boost
For Burn damage, so you don't need Elemental damage on gear

### Icy Weapons
![](/assets/posts/ancestral_legacy/icy_weapons.png)
_to trigger burn and chill enemies_

### Ice Prison
![](/assets/posts/ancestral_legacy/ice_prison.png)
_30% freeze chance to interrupt enemies_

## Future plan with more Ancestral Stones
If we got all seven Ancestral Stones available i would change Ice Prison to Light Wave. Icy Prison was choose to interrupt attacks,
but it has just a 30% to trigger and breaks instantly, because of our amount of hits we do. Light Wave blinds enemies in aoe and
for a longer duration.
