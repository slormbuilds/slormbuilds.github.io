Build explanation
=================

Core mechanic
-------------

This build centres around the reaper, [BOW OF CONCENTRATED INNER STRENGTH](#reaper). This is raw damage build based on indirect damage. It involves stacking attack speed and cooldown reduction to increase the uptime of Concentration and Smoke Screen.Whilst indirect damage builds have the severe disadvantage of not being able to benefit from on-hit effects, the Huntress has one special node on a skill which allows us to work around this.

Unlike normal IF builds, however, this build doesn't focus on IF chance on melee skills. Instead, we will be utilising the INNER RADIANCE ancestral legacy skill to spam IFs continually. This frees up an attribute slot on all your gear. 

### Why Huntress?
1. Stab gives you a node, FOUNTAIN OF MALADY, which allows you to lifesteal from poison damage
2. Mist-walker gives you a node, TOXIC FIRE, which imbues IFs with poison, meaning you can now lifesteal on IF damage when they apply poison. No other class can do this. 
3. Mist-walker's  BOOSTED TOXINS node lets you pop the poison damage on enemies instead of refreshing the duration for 40% of the remaining damage, which adds even more damage to the already beefed up build. Given how often poison is applied (and reapplied) to enemies, this is a constant source of damage. 

### BOW OF CONCENTRATED INNER STRENGTH {#reaper}
This reaper is the defacto best damage option for inner fire builds for the following reasons: 

1. Flat IF damage multiplier (350% at max rank)
2. Reaper damage is added to IF damage (normally, IF's only do raw damage)
3. Allows you to scale IF duration with IF charges, 1 second per additional charge. This frees up 2 more gear stats, IF max charges and chance. 
4. Primordial benediction gives you additional IF max charges multiplier, giving you even more scaling duration and damage output
5. Primordial malediction actually benefits the build instead of being detrimental
6. Grants two incredibly useful ancestral skills
7. "Fast Expansion" is cast at the start of the mission, to give you 5 IFs instantly
8. "Concentration" is the main damage skill in this build, doubling IF damage for 7 seconds


### WINDS OF HARMONY
This is one of two legendaries which are truly compulsory to the build. The cooldown time reduction afforded by this item is what allows you to be able to spam your Concentration and moke Screen abilities. Therefore, reinforcing this legendary brings the most value to the build. 

### GAZLOKA'S CONQUEST
This ring gives you +1 IF charge per crit, up to a maximum. This legendary effect saves you needing to roll IF max charges on your gear. However, be careful not to reinforce this ring too much as it would be a waste of resources. I have mine at +16 and am able to maintain 66 IFs easily at any given time. Any more than this, however, is not going to add to your damage since this number of IFs clears enemies offscreen with ease in all current game modes. 

Needless to say, triggering this ring means you will be building for crit chance and crit damage. Since these two stats are vital to increasing your damage output anyway, its a no-brainer. 

### Survivability
This build delivers many layered defenses. 
1. YOUNG PHOENIX FEATHER in case you get gibbed (not necessary, but certainly helps)
2. Life leech on poison damage from stab
3. Thornbite rune for scaling shield
4. Smoke Screen (with FAIRY DUST node) for invulnerability 
5. INDOMITABLE MOUNTAIN legendary to convert evasion to armour, which helps with the scaling for the thornbite rune. 

Attributes
----------

### Savagery
Go absolutely HAM on savagery. It has everything the build needs, raw damage for IF and reaper damage...also for IFs. 

### Fury
Remaining points can be thrown into Fury, for evasion and crit chance. 



Ancestral Legacy
----------------

### SCORCHED EARTH
Use this for travel, it's not necessary to do anything else. 

#### INNER RADIANCE
The mainstay of this build. Spam like crazy for infinite uptime on your IFs. 

#### THE VIPER and PAIN WEAVER
Good stats to have

#### BURNING SHADOW
A good option to increase your damage even further, should you wish it. You can easily lifesteal back the cost of this skill. 


Ultimatums
----------

### ULTIMATUM OF ADAMANT ABUNDANCE - Mana Regeneration
Save yourself a stat slot on your gear and use this ultimatum instead! It is more than enough to sustain the build. 

Gear
----

### Mod pool
In this priority order, you want the first available stat in the pool. Skip to the next if not available on this particular item:

1. Attack speed
2. Critical strike chance (until you hit the [crit cap](#reaching-crit-cap))
3. Crit Damage 
4. Raw damage (pure stat farmable here)
5. % Raw damage
5. Evasion
6. Armour
7. Armour penetration till 100% (optional. Doesn't add a great deal of damage but is still a decent option as it applies on every hit from IFs) 
7. Damage over Time (optional)
8. Damage to Elites (optional)


Common problems
---------------

### Low Move speed

I use FINESSE with the REACH OUT and DIVE IN! nodes to travel.
