* Each item can have up to 2 normal (Rings, amulets, belts and cape have 1, the rest have 2), 1 magic, 1 rare, 3 epic, 1 legendary stat, 1 slormsmith affinity (up to +5 levels), 1 mastery modifier (up to +2 levels) and 1 attribute modifier (up to +3 points).

# Ultimatums

The ultimatums fix a specific stat to a certain number that can't be improved via gear stats, but they don't have effect on skills upgrades. You can unlock them upon reaching specific floors in the Slorm temple. Unlike the runes, they are not random.  
The ultimatums can be upgraded with pure slorm, and the Max lvl is 15.

# Gear: Stats Growth

as stated in the patch 0.2  
  
> Reinforcement now offers diminshing returns. +1 Reinforcement gives a +15% bonus, +2 gives +14% bonus, up to +15 and above granting a +1% bonus to the Reinforced stat.  
> That is instead of the former Reinforcement that granted +15% bonus to stats, at any Reinforcement level.

  
This bonus is accumulative. That mean when you reinforce an item to 2, the next bonus is 29% (15%+14%) of the base stats. When you go past the 14 reinforcement, the rest of the reinforcement will add 1% the base stat.  
  
![](/assets/steam_guides/2669188162/32829627)  
  
*When you select an equipment To upgrade with Rick, you can see 3-4 colors on the numbers  

* White (Teal if the stat is pure) is the current value of your equipment.
* The orange numbers are the added value to those stats in case of a successful upgrade.
* The grey numbers are the base value of those stats.*  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
This growth use the real stat value, stats in % are rounded to every 0,5% (except the leech stats).  
  
> Yep, this is because internally, the game don't store the value as "12%" but rather a value from 1 to 100  
> Meaning that with the rounded value, the game shows you 12%, but in reality it's more like 11.9 (i don't know the exact value, but u get the point)   
> And therefore the multiplicative bonus of reinforcement don't give the exact same value

  
![](/assets/steam_guides/2669188162/25702151)  
  
Ex:  
Looking at the minion damage, all those items have the same base value. But all helmets have the same growth but the cape have a little bit more. All those bonus are from 0 to 1 reinforcement. That mean the cape have different real value.  
personal note: change this pic  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Since the Royale update, the legendary effects can benefit from reinforcement, up to lvl 15, because those effects have no diminishing return.

When you go to Rick, you have 2 tabs.  
  
![](/assets/steam_guides/2669188162/25674018)  
  
  
  
-The first tab is the reinforcement. When you see this tab, you have 5 values and 5 slots.  
  
**Values**  

* Potential: the base success rate, you fill this bar by gaining exp with the item equiped. You don't need to fill this stat to reinforce an item, but it's recomended.
  
* Critical reinforcement: the chance of getting +15% potential after a successful critical reinforcement.
  
* Double reinforcement: the chance of reinforce the selected equipment twice.
  
* Failure: it's the chance of failing a reinforcement, this value is multiplier (ex: if you have a 80% success rate and 50% failure, the final number is 40%).
  
* Calculated success rate: when i mention this value, is the one on the right, it shows the final succes rate.

  
  
**Slots**  

* Equipment (Top left): there's not much to say about this one, you drop the equipment you want to reinforce.
  
* Slormite (Top right): In this slot you can drop any slormite, different tiers have different bonus/penalty depending of the reinforcement tier of your equipment. You can only use one unit.
  

| Tier | Critical (%) | Double (%)(rounded down) | Failure (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| item tier = Slormite | 10 | 4,5 | 0 |
| item tier > Slormite | 10 | 4,5 | 50 per - tier\* |
| item tier < Slormite | 10 + (10 per + tier) | 4,5 + (4,5 per + tier) | 0 |

  
  
\*This value can exceed the 100%, but the game will not display the excess  
  
**-Slormite merge and Reinforcement base cost**

* Extras: The last 3 slots are optionals, but they can help with the reinforcement stats, you can use slormandrites or slormelines, with different effects. You can use 3 differents slormandrites and slormelines in any quantity. Adding items in those slots will increase the price of the reinforcement.
  
**-Slormandrites effect and cost**  
  

| Slormandrite | Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| of aptitude | +241~242 | +5% Critical reinforcement +3% Critical potential (increase the bonus potential of the critical reinforcement) |
| of harmony | +231~232 | -1% failure chance. |
| of fate | +154~155 | +1% Reinforcement chance, Critical reinforcement, Critical potential, Double reinforcement, and failure (yup, 1% of each) |

| Magic | +210 | +0.5% |
| Rare | +948 | +2% |

Note: the cost is the same for all slormelines tiers, what change is the tier of the item.  
  
-The second tab, is the slormite merge, you can merge different tiers of slormites using 3 of the slormites of the previous tier (tier 1 need 3 tier 0, tier 2 need 3 tier 1, etc), except the tier 0, this tier need 25 normal and 10 magic fragments.

# Runes: General

Runes are another layer of customization added in the great forge update.  
The game have 3 types of runes and you can only use one of each type, Activation, Effect and enhancement.  
If you equip a rune when you have a reaper with the same name equiped, the rune will have no effect  
Currently, there are 7 activation runes (1 per Slormsmith), 14 effect runes (2 per Slormsmith) and 7 enhancement runes (1 per Slormsmith).  

* Activation runes state the effect runes activation condition.This condition is modified by the constraint in the effect rune.
* Effect runes gives you extra effects when the activation runes conditions are fulfilled.
* Enhancement runes gives general improvements to the effect runes, like reactivation chance, amplified effect, constraint reduction, etc.

  
Each rune can be upgraded with the spirits of their slormsmith.  
The Max lvl for the runes is 15.
