# Overview

first of all thank to hiraku, i used your guides as a template/guideline to make my own guide ^^'  
  
The build is focusing on the legendary " EARTHBREAK ".  
  
[previewicon=23091337;sizeThumb,inline;shoulders leg.PNG][/previewicon]  
  
  
**Wich mean you will not be able to play it without this item**.  
  
There is another legendary that is not mandatory, but will help tremendously with the gearing process.  
and this is the legendary bracers " Damasius Awarness "  
  
[previewicon=23091447;sizeThumb,inline;bra.PNG][/previewicon]  
  
since it let you have around 50% crit chance on your gear to be optimal instead of 70/75%.   
  
Now that you are aware of the mendatory item you need let start with the guide.  
  
  
**PRO** :  
  
- Very strong (kill and entire room in 2 -3 click)  
- Very fast farming (you just walk in a room and everything died)  
- Insane AoE  
- I'm singin' in the rain  
  
**Cons**:  
  
- Relient on a specific Legendary to work  
- Really squishy on rift start without the right set of legendaries  
- No mouvement speed apart from the gear  
- Meteor doesn't leech life ,and grapplingling hook having a 2 sec CD this mean you have a 2 sec CD on your leech life so you need to be extra carefull.  
  
  
  
  


# Reaper

The best Reaper to use is the **big fury sword** since Astral meteor is using skill Damage   
  
**The most powerful sword** is ok too  
  
**Sword of the nimble warrior** can be use at the start if you dont have enough crit chance and/or ancestral strike chance

# Main and Secondary skills

The main skill in this build is :  
**Grappling Hook**  
  
  
Mastery 1   
 - single target : chain link  
 - AoE/farming : Long chain  
  
Mastery 2   
 - Captain Hook  
  
Mastery 3  
 - Gather Intel  
  
Mastery 4  
 - Shining star  
  
Mastery 5  
 -Miracle : Head Slam  
  
basically every ancestral strike grappling hook's doing, an Astral meteors proc thanks to the "earthbreak" legendary.  
since we are playing captain hook we can gather all the room in once and with enough crit chance and ancestral strike chance you will see a LOT of meteors falling down on everyone  
  
 Chain link can be better on single target thanks to "enhanced luck" trait from the specialization letting you chain a lot of grappling hook when you are lucky, but long chain will be much faster overall.  
  
  
  
**Secondary skill can be whatever you want**   
  
Personally i play with **the elder lance** for the **align the star** trait from rank 2  
  
  
The other rank doesn't matter   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**You can play more defensively with creste shield**   
   
   
  
  
The others rank doesn't matter  
You juste need to have it in one of your skiils slots to always have minimum 15 % blocks   
  
  
   
  


# Specialization

**Haphazard Champion**  
  
Mastery 1  
 - Astral Descent  
 Mastery 2  
 - Elder Retribution  
Mastery 3  
 - Astral repercussion  
Mastery 4  
 - To Glory  
Mastery 5  
 - Blessed Strike  
Mastery 6  
 - Armageddon  
Mastery 7  
 - Rain of Meteors  
Mastery 8  
 - enhanced Luck  
  
All the damage multiplier come from here, with Astral Descent and Armageddon, and we get A lot of proc thanks to Rain of Meteors to double our meteor procs and Blessed Strike to get the proc in the first place .  
  
all the reste are little bonuses   
  
  
  
  
  


# Attributes

  
  
**30 Fury**  
Get to rank 30 to get   
[previewicon=23092796;sizeThumb,inline;Captureawdawd.PNG][/previewicon]  
  
**Then everything else on Savagery**

# Ancestral Legacy

  
  
**Burning Shadow**  
  
Big damage buff on demande  
  
**Vengeful Hero**  
  
Some stat cause why not  
  


# Gear Stat Priority

**Required Stats**  
  
Mana & Life Leech, one roll of each, aim to get these on epic stats to free up important magic/rare stats.  
  
  
**Critical chance** depand on if you have the damasius awarness legendary or not, you should aim for 50/55% crit on your gear with the legendary (see on the gif at the end i am at 52% critical strike chance and its more than enough) and 70/75% whitout   
  
**Once you have the required crititical chance the reste goes as follow :**  
  
**Offensive Stats**  
  
**ancestral strike chance** on every gear/slot that can have it  
Critical Damage  
Raw Damage  
Damage to Elites  
  
**Defensive Stats**  
Maximum Life (flat and %)  
  
**Reaper Stats**  
+5 Astorias  
  
**Mastery Stats**  
  
does not really matter since we are not using the damage from the skill itself, you can use mastery levels to fill in the skills mastery until they're high enough without.  
  
**Attribute Stats**  
  
fury until rank 30 then everything else on savagery

# how to play

At the start dont forget to use inextricable tourment aura if you have the legendary  
  
then just use your grappling on everything to see the apocalipse rain down on everyone , juste be carefull when you dont have the gather intel stack up you can very easily be one shoted.  
   
dont forget to use your Ascention on cd to get the fury attributes bonus
