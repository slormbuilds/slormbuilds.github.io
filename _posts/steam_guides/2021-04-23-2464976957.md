# Overview

first of all thank to hiraku, i used your guides as a template/guideline to make my own guide ^^'  
  
The build is focusing on the legendary " EARTHBREAK ".  
  
[previewicon=23091337;sizeThumb,inline;shoulders leg.PNG][/previewicon]  
  
  
**Wich mean you will not be able to play it without this item**.  
  
There is another legendary that is not mandatory, but will help tremendously with the gearing process.  
and this is the legendary bracers " Damasius Awarness "

since it let you have around 50% crit chance on your gear to be optimal instead of 70/75%.   
  
Now that you are aware of the mendatory item you need let start with the guide.  
  
  
**PRO** :  
  
- Very strong (kill and entire room in 2 -3 click)  
- Very fast farming (you just walk in a room and everything died)  
- Insane AoE  
- I'm singin' in the rain  
  
**Cons**:  
  
- Relient on a specific Legendary to work  
- Really squishy on rift start without the right set of legendaries  
- No mouvement speed apart from the gear  
- Meteor doesn't leech life ,and grapplingling hook having a 2 sec CD this mean you have a 2 sec CD on your leech life so you need to be extra carefull.  
  
  
  
  

# Reaper

The best Reaper to use is the **big fury sword** since Astral meteor is using skill Damage   
  
**The most powerful sword** is ok too  
  
**Sword of the nimble warrior** can be use at the start if you dont have enough crit chance and/or ancestral strike chance
