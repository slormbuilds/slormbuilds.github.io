# Introduction

This guide is for a character that only \*needs\* to move around and not use a single skill for the vast majority of the time thanks to some new ancestral skills and the ridiculous evasion and mana scaling of Huntress with The Untouchable One. Using this setup, I mostly ran around, maybe held my Rain of Arrows button down from Great Forge 1 to 100 in W10.

Since I know the first question will be if the Primordial is requiredâ€¦ it kind of is.  
Non Primordial:  
412k Elemental Damage  
34k Thornbite shield up to 345k  
  
Primordial:  
1430k Elemental Damage  
468k Thornbite shield up to 4.68 million  
  
Functional to use for lower Wrath tiers, but it's a world of difference.

# Overview

Bow of the Untouchable One
==========================

  
\* Scales base evasion up to incredibly high numbers for survivability. This number speaks for itself.

Architect of Death
==================

  

* Evasive Magic (T1) - Increases mana by the large amount of evasion
* Force Transmission (T6) - Increases elemental resistance by your evasion

Ancestral Legacy
================

:  
This is the primary damage and half of the scaling connection. While there isn't a loop that causes infinite scaling anymore, it's still mandatory to have high source of elemental damage from the mana that will feed back into the evasion. **Elemental Lock** provides that scaling, powered by **Air Conditioner** and **Lowey's Gratitude**. The burn damage acquired will do the heavy lifting for damage. In order to rely on the burn from the aura, you will need at least 50% Aura Increased Effect to get the cooldown to .5s. Anything beyond 50% will have no effect.

Runes:
======

  
The rune combination is the other half of the survivability. While the evasion and elemental resistance are incredibly high and you'll probably never die, using this rune guarantees it inside the Great Forge (almost) regardless of the upgrades chosen.

Character Attributes:
=====================

  
Objective:  

* Willpower 40
* Fury 55
* Extra into Fury

  
Leveling/Gearing:  
Use this if you don't have at least 50% Aura Increased Effect  

* Zeal 20 or 25
* Fury 55

# Gear

The gearing is fairly straight forward, due to the scaling with evasion, so I will point out just extra things.  

* You need 50% Increased Aura Effect. Ideally on Epic stats, but can be acquired on several slots like Cloak and Belt until then.
* Burn can crit, so crit chance and crit damage will still be valuable as offensive increases.
* Damage over Time applies separately after all other effects making it a good offensive stat for Burn
* Area Increased Effect applies separately after all other effects making it a good offensive stat for Rain of Arrows
* Flat evasion and evasion % on anything that cannot have crit or crit damage.
* Max Life is unnecessary, Armor is unnecessary, Elemental Resistance, damage reduction, life leech, etc, are all unnecessary. Your defense is your Thornbite shield that scales off evasion and will refresh as you kill!
* No legendaries are required, Heart of Darkness (Chest), Ancestral Champion's Present (Ring), and Slormandrite-Infused Diadem (Helm) are worth it.
* Indomitable Mountain is interesting if you want all defensive stats to be above 99%, and try an offensive rune, but I didn't try this.
* Ultimatum doesn't really matter!

  
  
For reference on my gear, without auras and without primordial, 9456 Added Flat Evasion with 6% (Fury), 11% (Fury), 50% (Heart of Darkness), 165% (Untouchable One) multipliers. Of that Added Flat, 1280 is from the Raw damage scaling into Evasion. Only 1 of item has a Pure evasion stat, under 50%.

# Skills

Rain of Arrows:  
When burn isn't going quickly enough, use this to kill faster.  

* Business Class (T1) - Projectiles land faster
* Starfire Rain (T2) - Required to do any damage
* Barrage Shot or Covering Fire (T3) - More area effect or more single target. Up to what you feel is needed.
* Artillery Pinpoint (T4) - Small dps boost
* Everything is Awesome (T5) - This is the only skill you'll use, so you'll stay Delighted and gain 50% attack speed.

  
  
Arrow Shot:  
You'll never use this skill.  

* Arrow of Elusion (T3) - Make sure to stay Delighted for this bonus.

# Great Forge

Take advantage of the fact that you cannot die and always choose anything that doesn't make the enemies take longer to kill. This means avoiding invulnerability, max life, and damage over time resistance. Everything else is fair game however, so have fun targeting your desired loot!  
  
Good luck!
