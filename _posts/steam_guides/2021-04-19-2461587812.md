# Introduction

**\*\* Warning: this build was for an older version of Slormancer. The concept of Big Fury and Savagery is still valid \*\*  
  
As a result of the Big Fury and itemization nerfs, character sheet damage at level 40 will be ~150k instead of ~500k. Still extremely strong and easy, but no longer trivializes Wrath10.  
  
At level 60, with only a few items upgraded to ilvl 60, am now seeing ~270k which is enough to comfortably do Wrath9.**  
  
Build for the Mage strongly focusing on Big Fury and Savagery to buff up Arcane Missiles to Wrath 10 screen clearing levels. You do not need to use your other skill slot, but I recommend Arcane Breach, though not for the reason you may be expecting. Can fully clear a W10 floor in under 3 minutes, and still has room to grow with item levels.  
  
Playstyle:   
Enter filled room. Set up Wall of Omen. Shoot Arcane Missiles. Room becomes empty. Run through Wall of Omen to run to the next room.
