# Skills & Upgrades notes

Time warp
=========

  
This mastery gives you mobility, mana and shield sustain, and damage.  
Phlegmatic scholar with orb of the headmaster, you can get 10% extra crit chance, Experienced battlemage gives extra crit damage, and free 50% attack speed, since your HP can't go below 1  
  

Orb of the arcane master
========================

  
This is the main source of damage, despite having upgrades with downsides, you can toss them through the window, thanks to the Wristlet of the orb master. This legendary brace removes the damage and cooldown penalty from the upgrades.  
You can cover more ground with Ethereal cloning pad shoulder piece, Need back up! and Greater primal orb upgrades  
  

Arcane breach
=============

  
this skill is mostly used in case you need to clump enemies in one place, for example when you fight multiple professors, for that reason in this build i focus in Area of effect, and Gravitational force upgrades, plus the extra attack speed is neat.  
If you have mana leech or on hit, or life leech or on hit with Life shaper, you can use it to recharge your mana.
