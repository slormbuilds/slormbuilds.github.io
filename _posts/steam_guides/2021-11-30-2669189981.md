# idk, i have to type a tittle

1-Go to act 2, VIII (the storage room)  
2-Kill the bosses  
3-Enjoy the firework  
4-Loot  
  
Even if you don't get a legendary, you can get a good amount of goldus (it's more time efficient than wrath 10). i got 9 legendaries in an hour, so tell me how it goes for you.  
  
Tips:  
1-Use the filter to save time  
2-If you don't have problem with the fight, use the Ultimatum of endless wealth  
  
That's all folks
