# Legendary items

**Mandatory**  

* Young phoenix feather
* Brightsteel warden
* Damasius awareness
* Gazloka's Conquest

  
**Recommended**  

* Amulet of Transference + Heavens of Steel
* Sahrusiel's Pact
* Immortal grasp
* Sunlight essence

# Stats priority

Unlimited
=========

  

* Elemental damage (Much as you can)
* HP regen (Flat if possible)
* Armor and Elemental resistance
* Max HP (Flat if possible)
* Inner fire duration
* Increased aura effect
* Life on hit

  

Limited
=======

  

* **Inner fire chance:**  With one piece of gear with this stat is enough.
* **Critical chance:** With around 40% - 50% should be enough.
* **Mana Regen:** Assign enough points to sustain Whirlwind. I don't recommend Mana on hit or kill, because those effects only proc on direct damage.

  

Capped
======

  

* Elemental damage penetration

# Pros & Cons

Pros:
=====

  

* Good clear speed.
* You have immunity to damage for 6 seconds with Deflect, and you can reduce the cooldown with the effect of Kah Veer.
* Fast movement speed, even while channeling whirlwind.
* With inner fire, you can kill, even when you're unable to use skills.
* You can stack block really fast.

  

Cons:
=====

  

* Since Thunderstruck and inner fire doesn't count as direct damage, and Whirlwind and Deflect deal low damage, you can't get much benefit from Life leech.
* You need to move, because of thunderstruck's proc range is near the source of damage (you).
* The game can get laggy in The great forge.

# Skills & upgrades notes

Deflect
=======

  
Deflect is the primary source of defense, the secondary being the block mechanic. It helps you to stack block stacks, stun chance for 3 seconds on block, immunity when Deflect is active, and Elder armor duplicate the chest item's stats.  
This skill can't be spammed, but with the help of primordial Kah Veer, you can use it with more frequency.  
  

Whirlwind
=========

  
This skill is used to proc Thunderstruck and other secondary effects able to crit, like dancing sword, Arcane beam, Inner fire, and Electric overcharge. In addition to that, having Repealing tornado can help you to stack block faster.  
The reason why i choose Dancing blade over Miracle: Arcanic storm, is because Arcanic storm proc it's effect when Whirlwind is perfect, while Dancing blade have 10% chance to proc per second and 100% chance when it's perfect. Other than that, Arcanic storm cast 5 Arcane beams in random directions, while Dancing blade deal damage around you, within the Thunderstruck proc range.  
  

Crest shield
============

  
Crest shield have 2 upgrades i use in this build, similar to Deflect, but slightly better or the same.  
  
**Block per second**  
  
![](/assets/steam_guides/3005063796/32596725)

T3: Common usage

Crest shield  
T1: Barrage

**By assigning Crest shield (with those upgrades), you can invest in:**
