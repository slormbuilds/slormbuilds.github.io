# Pros & Cons

Pros:
=====

  

* Good clear speed, larger groups can be wiped faster.
* Tanky.
* You don't need to invest in raw, overtime, overdrive damage, etc., since the main source of damage is the sword of the trainee effect.

  

Cons:
=====

  

* Low damage per hit, fighting with fewer enemies can take a little bit longer.
* You need additional projectiles stat.
* The camera can bug when there's too many overdrives active in the great forge, like High health bonus or assimilation.

# Skills & Upgrades notes

Wood stick
==========

  
This skill is the main source of damage for tight spaces, or spammed to get more armor. If you don't have enough mana per hit, you can replace Armor of the forest with Return on investment, until you get Mana on hit from your gear.  
If you have enough Mana on hit to spam both skills, you can root enemies with Root of the forest.  
Eruption of the forest and Forest blast trigger splinter explosions, meaning you have more procs.  
  

Throw sword
===========

  
This skill is the main source of damage for crowds in open space. Like Wood stick, this skill is used as offense and defense, since you can stack block and apply slow. Is important to get the Bleeding overdrive and Bloodshed upgrades, since those are the main procs from this skill.  
In an additional note, equip this skill in your secondary slot, so you can benefit from Fury 60 (+100% Overdrive bounce multiplier).
