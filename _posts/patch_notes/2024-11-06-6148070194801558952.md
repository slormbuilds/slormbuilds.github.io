Welcome to The Slormite Chronicles #43!  
  
Since our last Slormite Chronicles, we've been working on the remaining features that we want to have in The Slormancer for the 1.0 release. Here's our monthly recap of our current progress with The Warlords Update (The 1.0 Update!).  
  
What's Done
-----------

  
  
The Warlords endgame mode is now complete and playable from start to finish. We've added about 20 new Cataclysms to The Slormancer, 25 Warlords Bosses for the player to challenge and a fancy new map to navigate the mode.  
  
Since the last Slormite Chronicles, we've added unique skins to each Warlord. And even though, each Warlord is based on an enemy that's already in the game, we wanted to add that unique "filled with raw slorm strength" look to each of them.

We've also been working on Environments and tried to offer a different experience than the regular Battlefield Expeditions. The goal is to create a "Nether / Parallel Universe" kind of feeling, and it looks like this:

The Menu has also been finalized and we've added various info and tooltips regarding Loot during Warlords Expeditions.

About Warlords Drops: As mentioned in a previous Slormite Chronicles, you will be able to target-farm specific Legendary Items by defeating the corresponding Warlord. With 200 Legendary Items in The Slormancer, and 25 Warlords, each Warlord will be attributed 8 Legendary Items that it will be elligible to drop once you defeat him.  
  
The attribution changes everytime you defeat a Warlord, so you will have to fight a different Warlord if you didn't get the Legendary Item that you wanted.  
  
Once you defeat a Warlord, you will get to open a Chest with a Choice:

On the screenshot above, you can see that the player has a choice between 3 different Legendary Items that were elligible to loot on this Warlord. The player will also be able to reroll each slot (once) for a copious amount of Slorm (that we will adjust if necessary).  
  
This means that once a player has cleared The Netherworld and is able to defeat every Warlord, it should be relatively easy to target-farm specific Legendary Effects.  
  
**Now onto Nether Equipment!**  
As you may have noticed on the screenshot above, there is a new Equipment Rarity called Nether, that we've talked about in a previous Slormite Chronicles.  
  
Nether Equipment can only be found when defeating a Primordial Warlord (A Level 100, Wrath 10 Warlord). On the screenshot above, the Chance to get a Nether Equipment is displayed and is currently about 25% and is be increased by your Influence in the current Environment.  
  
Nether Equipment can be increased up to Level 120 and can be Grafted Stats and Legendary Effects from other Equipments. This means that you will be able to add Stats and Legendary Effects that were not available in this slot.

As you can see in the screenshot above, I have a Nether Amulet with a Legendary Cloak Effect.  
  
You will be able to Graft up to 3 Stats and / or Legendary Effects to a Nether Item, and all of this will be available with Friedrich, the Blacksmith, as usual.

**Miscellaneous (yet important) stuff**  
We've added our final Achievements regarding The Warlords Expeditions before the 1.0, we've also added all the missing tutorials and wrote the final dialogues leading to an epic conclusion!  
We've also added Part III of the Trials and unlocked the remaining Slorm Reapers and these are preeetty strong.  
  
The 1.0 is getting closer and closer!  
  
What's Missing
--------------

  
  
We're now only missing exactly two elements to get to the end of development:  
  
[\*]The Final Boss Fight agains Ohm Agad, that I will continue working on as soon as I post this Chronicle.  
[\*]The 120 Legendary Effects that are missing to get to 200. It is not so dauting as it seems because, we already have everything layed out and planned, I have the texts, names and tooltips ready, so we're just talking about coding the Effects.  

  
  
So we're definitely getting closer than ever to our 1.0 release. Now, I've mentioned before and I'll say it again: once we get to the end of development, we won't be immediately releasing The Slormancer out of Early Access. We will work on translating the game, playtesting it, refining it, along with trying to catch as much attention as we can before the release.   
  
So we're almost done, but not quite there yet.  
  
That's about it for today!  
Cheers everyone!
