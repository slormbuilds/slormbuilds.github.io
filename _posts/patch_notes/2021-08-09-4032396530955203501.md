Hi everyone!  
  
Here's the complete of changes for today's patch:  
  
**Steam Cloud**  
There is now a Cloud/Local save manager to handle conflicts.  
You will most likely get a warning when launching the game the next time.  
It will look like this:  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/7c149e4d16f146e630fa049d6466a787b720b393)  
  
Do not panic. if you've been playing since The Slorm Temple update, picking your local save should be the correct option. If in doubt, the playtime should be a good indicator.  
  
The game will take care of the rest and normally upload to Steam Cloud as it used to before.  
  
*If you accidentally pick the wrong file, you will have the opportunity to recover so don't do anything and contact us.*   
  
  
**Balance**  
Just a quick balance pass on Spiders : Web's timer is no longer resetted if you already are affected by a Web effect.   
On top of that, when the Web effect ends, you have a small immunity window where you are immune to webs so it should be much easier to escape most situations.  
  
  
**The Slorm Temple**  
Since there were some issues with finding Olorin, we've added a couple of infos:  
* Olorin now has its own minimap icon.
* Olorin now explains where he is located when he gets back to the village.
* Scaling of enemies should now work properly in The Slorm Temple after floor 260+.
* You should no longer be stuck in the Temple Shrine when it lifts up.

  
That's about it for now!   
Have fun!
