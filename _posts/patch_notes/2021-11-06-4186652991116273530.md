Hello everyone!   
  
As you may have heard, the Prison Update will be available on Monday (November 8th) so you will be able get your hands on what we've been working on really soon.   
  
We've talked about almost everything that's coming in previous [Slormite Chronicles](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/3031477153097195286) so we will use this one as a Patch Notes / Recap of what's coming instead.  
  
  
The Slorm Temple
================

  
- The Slorm Temple no longer has to be reset to collect Pure Slorm (and can no longer be reset anyway).  
- You can complete the same Floor multiple times and still get Pure Slorm.  
- The Slorm Temple now contains deadly traps and will defend itself.  
- The Slorm Temple has a timer based on the number of rooms you have to explore and your current floor.  
- As the timer progresses, the floor will get more challenging.  
- There is now a boss in The Slorm Temple called the Temple Keeper.  
- Olorin is now always available in town.  
- You can also purchase Upgrades from Olorin from inside the Temple.  
- Both "Flat Pure Slorm Reward" and "% Pure Slorm Reward" upgrades have been removed and replaced by new upgrades.  
- Visions and their Upgrades have been removed.  
- You can now find "Ultimatums" in The Slorm Temple. A new type of Item.  
- Ultimatums can be upgraded at Olorin's Shop using Pure Slorm.  
- You can now find Pure Slorm randomly inside the Slorm Temple.  
- Salvaging Items with Pure Stat will now grant you a bit of Pure Slorm.   
- Olorin's Panels are now unlocked much faster: Instead of being unlocked at Floor 50 and 100, they are unlocked at Floor 10, 15 and 20.  
  
- Elder Slorm now takes a physical form that you have to pick up when you kill an Elite. It is automatically picked up once you walk close to it (like a Shield Globe).  
  
**If you have played the previous version of The Slorm Temple:**  
- You will be refunded of all Pure Slorm spent on Upgrades that have been removed.  
- You will be awarded of all Pure Slorm currently locked.  
- Your progress will resume at the Highest Floor you've ever achieved.  
- HOWEVER, since there are a few new things to unlock along the way, the game will cap you to the lowest level in which you have new things to find. Example: If you were at Floor 201 in the old Slorm Temple, you will be capped at Level 10, where there is something of importance to find. Once, you've completed Level 10, you will be capped to the next lowest level, until you've found everything you had to. Once you do, you will be able to resume your progress at Floor 201.

I think that's about it but I may have forgotten a thing or two.  
  
We've also fixed a good amount of bugs that we've encountered during our playtests but we were not particularly focused on bug hunting for this update. We'll get to it later. :)  
  
  
What's Next?
============

  
We have our next update planned and we are ready to work on new exciting things as soon as we know that this update is stable and that everything is running smoothly.  
  
New Reapers would be nice, don't you think?  
  
  
Have a nice day everyone!  
See you on Monday!
