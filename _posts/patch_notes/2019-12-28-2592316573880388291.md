Hello everyone!  
  
We're still working on additional procedural environments right now and for the upcoming couple of weeks. We've completed "The Prison" area last week and we took the time to slightly rework "The Royal Wing".  
  
The Royal Wing was the very first area that we created, around 2 years ago, and was our first try with procedural generation. So we had a few things to upgrade.

If you want to check the other areas we've completed: The Graveyard and The Luxurious Gardens, you can read this [post](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1104280/eventcomments/3338785229796534110)!  
  
That's it for now! We should be back around mid-January with informations about the last area we want to have ready for Early Access.
