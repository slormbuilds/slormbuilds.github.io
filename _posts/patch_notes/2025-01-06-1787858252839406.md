Happy New Year everyone!  
  
Same as last year (and the year before that), this Chronicle will be a recap of the past year. We actually really wanted for 2024 to be the year of our release in 1.0 but as always, everything took more time than anticipated and we knew early on that we weren't going to make it.   
  
If the Final Update wasn't leading to the 1.0 Release, we could have managed to sneak it in 2024 since it is mostly done, but preparing for our release requires much more than just being done with development, so we had to delay it.  
  
A Year of Chronicles: 2024 Edition
----------------------------------

  
*Fun fact: You may not know this but we publish the Slormite Chronicles devlog every 6th of the month, which is the day The Slormancer was released (on April 6, 2021). Everytime we publish a Slormite Chronicles, the game gets one month older, and it is currently 3 years and 9 months old.*

We started the year with **The Slorm Reapers Update**, introducing 68 new Slorm Reapers, and getting the number of available Slorm Reapers to our target of 120. This was definitely no easy task.  
  
Fun fact 2: 6 or 7 years ago, a friend of us (the composer, actually) was playtesting an early version of the game, that had about 10 to 15 Slorm Reapers (in a very rough form), and he told us that Slorm Reapers were super fun to find, collect and upgrade and that we should have more. And for some reason, I said "Ok cool, let's go with 120" without giving it a second thought.   
Considering how big of a task creating a single one often, and how small our team is, it was *slightly* too much. No regrets though, it's actually one of the aspects of the game we're the most proud of.

Then, we introduced our 2024 Roadmap, leading to The Final Update. We anticipated 3 Updates to get to The Final Update, and it turned out to be accurate (still missing that last Update though).

The **Slormite Chronicles #35** led to **The Encyclopedia Update (0.8)**, introducing a few key elements: Achievements, a Codex and proper tutorials, and [MASSIVE Performance enhancements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buaOvu6cVu0).  
  
During this Update, we've also prepared a few things that are still not available: Steam Cards, Profile Frames and Steam Achievements. Everything will be available for the 1.0 launch though.

**Slormite Chronicles #36, #37 and #38** mostly talk about Balance since it was a very important focus of the year 2024. We actually started brainstorming around March and quickly started talking about upcoming changes in Slormite Chronicles. The feedback we got has helped us getting in the right direction tremendously.  
  
<https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/4170974735564951689>  
  
We eventually published a Patch Notes a month before the actual Update, and made a bunch of changes based on the feedback we again got.  
  
<https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/4264427597934140423>  
<https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/4264427597952925408>  
  
We then published The Balance Update on The Experimental Branch to further polish it.   
I've said it then, and I'll say it again here: Going through Experimental was a great experience, it involves much less stress than going straight to the Live Branch.   
  
Everything gets to be properly tested, and if something is not working properly, players can always go back to Live Branch so I'm never in a stressful emergency situation, having to quickly debug and patch something preventing most players to play.  
  
<https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/4354502761456383826>  
<https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/4592070813181408319>  
  
The Balance Update was released a couple of months later on the Live Branch and everything went smoothly!

<https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/4480614335784159155>  
  
Finally, the last 4 Slormite Chronicles of the year were about me talking about our work on The Final Update: creating a new endgame mode called The Warlords, Legendary Items, Nether Items, an epic Boss Fight, among other things. You should read them if you haven't.  
  
Next month, we should be able to talk about our Roadmap for 2025 and beyond the release. There's unfortunately not much more to announce today since there are still a few blurry things to figure out.  
  
That's about it for now!  
Cheers!
