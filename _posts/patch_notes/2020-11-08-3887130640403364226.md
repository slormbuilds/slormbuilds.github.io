Hi everyone!  
  
Today, we'd like to talk about what we've been working on these past few weeks: Crafting and Items.  
  
Disclaimer:  
If you've played the demo, you will notice that we have reworked a bunch of things on items: names, stats and slormite behavior. We'll talk about it in the post as well.  
  
Disclaimer 2:  
The state and inventory of the character displayed in the screenshots below does not represent accurately how the game works. I mean… It's a level 1 Knight with around 65 Millions Goldus and countless currencies of all sorts.  
  
  
Currencies
==========

  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/ef1e4ecce68267aff13c8af6c9b30ecdc0143c11)  
  
Let's talk about currencies before talking about Crafting, there are 4 sorts of currencies in the game (besides Gold): Slormites, Slormelines, Slormandrites and [strike]Slorments[/strike] Fragments.  
  
**Slormelines:**  
There are 5 **Slormelines**: One for each rarity, that will be useful everytime you want to modify, reforge or reinforce an item of equal rarity. You use a Rare Slormeline to modify a Rare Item etc…  
  
**Fragments:**  
Each Slormeline can be crafted using **Fragments**: There are 5 types of fragment, one for each rarity aswell. You get fragments by salvaging equipment. And you will need 100 fragments to create a Slormeline.  
  
*So basically: you salvage Rare equipment to get Rare fragments, you then use them to create Rare Slormelines that you can use to modify and enhance Rare Equipment. Easy enough.*  
  
**Slormandrites:**  
There are 6 other currencies we call **Slormandrites**:  
The Slormandrite of Fate  
The Slormandrite of Negation  
The Slormandrite of True Potential  
The Slormandrite of Aptitude  
The Slormandrite of Harmony  
The Slormandrite of Virtue  
  
Slormandrites can also be crafted using combinations of Fragments: The Slormandrite of True Potential, for example, needs 100 Normal Fragments, 50 Magic Fragments and 50 Rare Fragments.  
  
They all modify different aspects of an item and can be combined together or with Slormelines for more powerful effects.  
  
Examples: The Slormandrite of Fate, if used alone, rerolls all the unlocked Stat Values of an item.   
If used in combination with an Epic Slormeline, it will then only reroll the unlocked Epic Stat Values of an item (There are ways to lock stats of an item, preventing further modification).

**Slormites:**  
Then there are Slormites, that are used to Reinforce an item and all its stats. There are 15 different Slormites of different strength that can be used on your Equipment.  
  
Slormites can either be found or crafted using lower Slormites (except the very first, that needs Fragments).  
  
In The Slormancer, the ability to Reinforce an item is infinite and is only limited to your own dedication and time.

Crafting Menu
=============

  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/1e61f5f4c36a3c58627b8b9a7cf0972e5a2d6c5e)  
  
Here's what the crafting menu looks like.  
You can basically reforge absolutely everything on an item.  
Every single stat and score can be changed. You can also upgrade the rarity of items and transform a Normal Item you like to an insane endgame Legendary Item if you want to (and if you have enough currencies, money and dedication, of course).  
  
We tried to be as transparent as possible so you get to see the possible rolls before actually reforging, along with possible outcomes.  
  
**Bonus: New Effects:**  
On the screenshot above, you can actually see a Crest Shield Mastery Bonus and a Willpower Bonus.  
These are new effects that can be found (or added/reforged) on any equipment and that give you a small bonus.   
Getting a +2 Mastery bonus can open up new tiers of upgrades while getting Attribute bonuses can help you reach new Perks.  
These can be rolled on every slot and are cumulative, so you can reach high Mastery, Attribute or Reaper bonuses if you roll the correct effects.  
  
  
Reinforce Menu
==============

  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/6211a761a7a5553a382450a1987286830d7b8bc7)  
  
Known as The Slormitizer, this is the device that will let you Reinforce your items.  
  
*Note: If you've played the demo and have used Slormites, you should know that they no longer work the way they used to.*  
  
**Potential:**  
Equipment pieces have something we call "Potential" that you gain the same way you gain experience: by slaying monsters.   
This represents how easy Reinforcing the item will be.  
So basically, an item with 100% Potential will always be Reinforced succesfully while an item with 25% Potential will have 75% Chance to fail.  
  
**How to Reinforce:**  
To Reinforce an Item, you need an Item (duh…), a Slormite, and The Slormitizer.  
  
Besides Potential, there are a few things that can change the outcome of the Reinforcement:  
First, the quality of the Slormite you use: using a Slormite of tier that is too low compared to the level of your item will almost always trigger a Reinforcement Failure.  
Then, you can use Slormelines and Slormandrites to modify the outcome in your favor: some will simply increase your chance of success while other will increase Critical Reinforcement Chance or Double Reinforcement Chances.  
A Critical Reinforcement will give a small amount of Potential to your Item once it is Reinforced while a Double Reinforcement will Reinforce the item twice.  
  
When you Reinforce, whether you succeed or not, the Potential of your Item gets back to zero (unless the Reinforcement is Critical).  
  
  
Buying / Selling Equipment
==========================

  
  
You can also buy or sell items the good old fashion way.   
You can either buy random containers if you like randomness or buy specific items on sales that are renewed regularly.  
Here are a few screenshots of what the store looks like:

![](/assets/patch_notes/d9cacf8c47230e13c15fa0c4891a274638eade3e)  
  
  
That's it for now.  
We're getting closer to release so we should be able to give you a precise release date soon.
