Hi everyone!  
We've been working on new environments for the past month! As you may not know, The Slormancer will feature various procedurally generated environments.  
  
We aim to have 5 differents places for our Early Access release, and our goal is to create a different atmosphere and a specific "procedural behavior" for every environment, we don't want to just swap a tileset and be done with it.  
  
We've finished The Graveyard area about two weeks ago and we just completed The Luxurious Gardens area today!  
  
Here's how they look!

We hope you'll like it!  
  
It takes us two to three weeks to create a new environment so we should be done by the end of 2019.   
  
Next, we'll be working on The Prison followed by The Mage Academy. And we'll probably have to spend a bit of time on reworking The Royal Wing (our first environment, shown in the trailer and in pretty much every screenshot we've made so far).   
  
That's it for now!
