Hello everyone!  
  
As you probably may have heard, The Slormancer will be available in Early Access on April 6.  
  
And because it's an Early Access, we feel like we owe you a complete Road Map of how we plan to update the game during this period so that you you know exactly what you are buying and in what state the game currently is.  
For this reason, you might also want to check out the Q&A about Early Access on our [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1104280/The_Slormancer/).  
  
Above is the current Road Map we plan follow.  
However, please note that things may (and probably will) change based on players feedback but also based on our own ideas as we want to remain free to add unannounced features if we (or you) suddenly come up with a brilliant addition for the game.  
  
**In short, the Road Map is subject to change.**  
  
We will update this post when changes are made to the Road Map and keep a clean changelog aswell so you know what's happening at all times.  
  
Cheers!  
And see you on April 6.  
  
Want to see the trailer again? Fine…
