Hello everyone!  
  
The 0.2 patch has been tested on the Experimental branch for about 2 weeks so we're confident on the stability of the build. However, since we've made major changes to some systems and because upgrading a game engine is no easy task, some things might be broken or lag or freeze.   
If so, please report your issue on Steam or on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tkYxSuB) and we'll do our best to fix your issues as soon as possible.  
  
Patch 0.2 was mostly about us upgrading the game engine so everyone could enjoy the game without black screen or texture issues but we've also made balance changes that can be found below.  
  
  
Patch 0.2.05
============

  
If you've played on Experimental and if you've already read the 0.2 Patch Note, there are a couple of changes that have been made :  
  
* Movement Speed no longer works with Diminishing return. So it will stay the way it was during 0.1.94. The cost on fun was a bit too high compared to the effect on balance, so we'll propably come back to Movement Speed at some point with a smarter change but not right now.
* Elite Life Multiplier has been reduced by 25%. So the difference between Elites and regular enemies has been slightly reduced. We're aware that Elite enemies are currently quite tedious to fight and we have plans to rework them deeply. Until then, this felt like an appropriate change.

  
  
Here's the rest of the 0.2 Patch Note that was available on Experimental:  
  
  
Patch 0.2
=========

  
  
Game Engine Migration
=====================

  
* We've upgraded our game engine. Hopefully, all black screen issues should be resolved.
* Everyone with proper specs should now be able to play the game. If not, let us know!
* This also means that you should have better performance overall and slightly less FPS drops.

*This means that you might (will) run into things that no longer work anymore. If so, please let us know as soon as possible.*  
  
Resolution & Quality of Life
============================

  
* The Slormancer now supports the following resolutions:
+ 2560x1440
+ 3840x2160

* WINDOWED FULL SCREEN !
* You can now change the monitor where the game is displayed (by dragging it or by pressing WIN+SHIFT+(Left or Right)) to change it.
* Fonts should no longer be blurry/fuzzy. Text should be nice and sharp under every circumstance.
* Added an option to customize Interface and Damage Font Sizes.
* Added an option to Lock Cursor to screen.
* Added an option to hide Slorm when it is being gathered for readability.

  
  
Balance
=======

  
  
**Pure Stats**
--------------

  
* Stats found on items can now roll Critical scores and have a score ranging from 101% to 110% of their base value.
* Critical rolls are called "Pure" stats.
* A Pure stat whose score or stat is modified by Friedrich loses its Purity and gets back to a regular stat.
* Pure stats cannot be rolled by Friedrich and can be found on looted equipment or at Jemma's store.
* Pure stats are shown on Tooltips, and Items on the ground with a Pure stat are highlighted.
* Pure stats can be rolled on any stat (and on every stat, if you're lucky) of an item.
* Pure stats can only appear once level 25 has been reached.

  
**Craft**
---------

  
* Slormandrite of True Potentiel now increased the Level of your item by 1, up to your current level, instead of instantly bringing it to your current level.
* The Gold cost to Reroll Scores has been reduced by 60%.
* Gold cost to Add Stats and change the rarity of an item has been increased by 60%.
* The Gold cost of Rerolling Stats or Score and Locking and Unlocking Epic stats has been reduced by 40%.
* Gold cost of all operations on Reaper, Mastery and Attribute stats have been increased by 1000% as this should be late-game min-maxing, not something to consider doing on every new item equipped.
* The appearance rate of Reapers, Mastery and Attributes stats on looted items has been increased by 100%.

  
**Slormites and Reinforcement**
-------------------------------

  
* **Important:** Reinforcement now offers diminshing returns. +1 Reinforcement gives a +15% bonus, +2 gives +14% bonus, up to +15 and above granting a +1% bonus to the Reinforced stat.
That is instead of the former Reinforcement that granted +15% bonus to stats, at any Reinforcement level.
* Reinforcement cost rarity multiplier has been greatly reduced. On average, Reinforcement costs on Magic and higher items have been reduced by about 50%.
* This change also applies to Potential rarity multiplier, so it should be easier to increase the Potential of Rare+ items.
* **Important:** Bonus Reinforcement Chance given by Slormelines during Reinforcement have been changed. Instead of giving +10% Chance on items of equal rarity, Slormelines now work for every item regardless of rarity with the following rate:
+ Normal Slormeline: +0,1% Reinforcement Chance.
+ Magic Slormeline: +0,5% Reinforcement Chance.
+ Rare Slormeline: +2% Reinforcement Chance.
+ Epic Slormeline: +15% Reinforcement Chance.
+ Legendary Slormeline: +75% Reinforcement Chance.

  
**Changes on Items**
--------------------

  
The following changes only concern rolls you can get on Items.   
  
We realized how easy it was to get to high % stats on items, due to various factors, including how generous items were. As an example, it was quite easy to reach +100% Critical Strike Chance with a few pieces and a bit of crafting. This is true for most % stats, including game-breaking ones such as All Damage Reduction.  
  
Also, an important thing to keep in mind is that Level 40 items that you can currently loot right now ARE NOT rolling the highest % value. An item rolling Critical Strike Chance at Level 40 can grant up to 3% Critical Strike Chance while the same item rolling at level 70 will grant 5%.   
  
The following stats have been reduced by 50%:  
* Raw Damage %.
* Elemental Damage %.
* Critical Strike Chance.
* Ancestral Strike Chance.
* Elite Damage Reduction.
* Melee Damage Reduction.
* Projectile Damage Reduction.
* Area of Effect Damage Reduction.
* All Damage Reduction.
* Movement Speed %.
* Life Leech %.
* Mana Leech %.
* Pierce Chance %.
* Fork Chance %.
* Rebound Chance %.
* Area Increased Size % (Decreased by 25%).
* Area Increased Effect % (Decreased by 25%).

  
The following stats have been increased by 50%:  
* Life Regeneration %.
* Life on Hit %.
* Life on Kill %.
* Mana on Hit %.
* Mana on Kill %.
* Inner Fire Damage %.
* Overdrive Damage %.
* Overdrive Bounce Number % (Increased by 100%).

  
Additional Changes on Items:  
* **Important:** An item can no longer roll the same stat multiple times. Meaning if you have +10% Max Life as a Magic Stat, it can no longer be rolled as a Base, Rare or Epic stat. That is true for both crafting and loot.
*If you have items with multiple rolls of the same stats, you will be able to keep them for now and slowly transition to items of higher levels when we roll new upgrades and increase the level cap.  
These items will become invalid once we reach 1.0.** Melee, Projectile, Area of Effect and All Damage Reductions are now capped at 75%.
[strike]* Movement Speed now offers diminishing returns.[/strike]
* Life Regeneration % can now appear on Belts as a Magic/Rare stat.
* Raw Damage % can no longer appear in Armors, Belts and Boots as a Magic/Rare stat.
* Elemental Damage % can no longer appear in Belts, Shoulders and Bracers as a Magic/Rare stat.

* Willpower 30 (Elemental Prowess) has been swapped with 60 (Elemental Resistance).

+ The Fierce Huntress now has +1 Life on Hit at Level 1.
+ The Mischievous Mage now has +3 Life on Kill at Level 1.

Mastery Changes

Enemies Changes
