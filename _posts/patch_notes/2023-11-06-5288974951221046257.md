Hello everyone!  
  
It's Chronicle time!   
  
As mentioned in our previous Slormite Chronicles, we are currently working on building the last Slorm Reapers for The Slormancer. This is a long and quite difficult process but we're making good progress.  
  
We've now moved to production and I believe this part should take about a month. There are a lot of original (and hopefully fun) new concepts that require quite a bit of assets and resources, but we believe it's for the best.  
  
We don't have much gameplay to show yet, or at least nothing visually interesting, so we will instead continue to reveal upcoming Slorm Reapers. *(As always, everything is subject to change).*

The Slormancer being The Slormancer, we have a couple of circumvoluted and absurd concepts that we want to share with you, such as a Vegetable as a Slorm Reaper.  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/d4a544f823bc6114c3d7a836bcc280799bc1e202)*Go Tyler, Go!*  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/336424f1f76b01339ce13f4a93a8a84a13703224)*The Primordial Version has an effect called "Miscalculation" that reduces Critical Strike Chance or Ancestral Strike Chance to 0% before Probability occurs. It gets fun.*  
  
We also came up with a bunch of asymmetrical Slorm Reapers.   
Here's Legion, Reaper of Unity!

This Slorm Reaper gets stronger based on the number of Slorm Reapers you own called Legion.   
It has a total of 5 Evolutions, plus its base form, so adding up the Primordial Versions, it adds up to a total of 36 Slorm Reapers.  
  
On top of that, each evolution starts at level 1 and can be leveled up to 100.  
  

Complete Collection
-------------------

  
And here's a small preview of what a Slorm Reapers Collection looks like when complete!

That's about it for today!  
Cheers everyone!
