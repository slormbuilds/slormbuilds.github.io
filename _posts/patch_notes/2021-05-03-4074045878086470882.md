MAJOR BUGS:  
- Freezes should no longer occur  
- Breaches should always close when all enemies have been defeated  
  
Since these were top priority bugs, we did not had that much time to work on other things.  
  
Generals:  
- Projectile Knockback is no longer applied to Melee Skills :x  
- Critical/Ancestral Damages reduced to 0 should no longer count in the Expedition Recap  
- Result Menu should now properly display the time  
  
The Mighty Knight  
- Training Dummy should now properly work  
- You should now be able to properly cast Banners even when close to a wall  
  
The Fierce Huntress  
- Light Ballista should now be able to find a target when cast near walls  
  
The Mischievous Mage:  
- Improved Performance when channeling Ray of Obliteration (clones included), with more to come  
- Arcane Clones channeling should change their target less often (to prevent the Disco Night Club effect)  
- Arcane Clones should now be able to find a target when cast near walls  
- Remnant's Vulnerability now applies the debuff with the proper icon
