Hello everyone!  
Welcome to Slormite Chronicles #48!  
  
New Banner and Key Arts!
------------------------

  
Did you see the new banners? Aren’t they gorgeous? It took half of the team’s effort (so, one person) over the course of a few weeks to achieve this result. HyonD set aside their usual PixelArt to rework and improve our old banner, which—let’s be honest—had run its course!  
  
We went for an image with more contrasted colors and chose an orange logo to make it stand out from the rest of the image—and from the rest of the Steam store (so as many potential players as possible click on it! ;) ).

New Steam Page!
---------------

  
We have also revamped our Steam page with a modern update, featuring beautiful GIFs that complement the screenshots and trailers available at the top of the page.

You can check out the full page by following this link, but if you're reading this Chronicles, you most likely already own the game!

Release Date, when?!
--------------------

  
We have a release date that’s almost finalized. In fact, we’ve already scheduled a slot with Steam, but we want to be absolutely sure that everything is perfectly ready for the big day before making an official announcement.  
  
What I can say: We are currently working on a release date announcement video, which will be out by the end of April. We will post a news update on The Slormancer’s page, and we’re counting on you and our entire player community to share and spread the word to as many people as possible!  
  
What I can also say is that the game’s release won’t be too far off from the announcement. You won’t have to wait two months between the reveal and the actual launch. But enough teasing—more news is coming soon!  
  
Supporter Pack
--------------

With the game’s release, we will also be offering a DLC called the "Supporter Pack," which will be sold alongside the game and will include a cosmetic change for Bryan.  
  
Say goodbye to spectral blue—Bryan is reincarnating as a glowing yellow orb, adorned with ethereal wings. More celestial than ever, he now floats with divine (or almost divine) grace.  
  
But that’s not all! When Bryan transforms into a door, he no longer becomes just any door… he becomes a golden door. With Wings!

The main goal of the Supporter Pack is to offer an additional option for players who wish to support the game's development. We don’t have an exact price in mind yet, but it should be around the same price as the OST—approximately $6.  
  
Clarifications regarding before and after the release
-----------------------------------------------------

  
We've seen a few discussions and comments about what we plan to do for the release and beyond, so I’d like to clarify a few points:  
  
**Before the release: Experimental Branch**  
There will be an open beta on the game's Experimental branch before release, shortly after the release date announcement. This branch will mainly help us identify any major issues that might still be present in the game and ensure we’re fully prepared for the full-scale launch.  
  
**After the release: Ongoing support**  
What we’ve referred to several times as "The Final Update" is called that because it marks the final update for Early Access. It is absolutely not the final update for the game.  
  
First, we plan to continue fixing any potential bugs and adding quality-of-life features to the game. Then, we’ll likely keep updating the game with both free and possibly paid updates for a period of time that is yet to be defined.  
  
We had previously mentioned that the game might or might not receive updates depending on sales, but that’s no longer true. In fact, even if the game doesn’t sell very well after the Early Access release, it would still make sense for us to keep adding content and new features to attract more players. These days, it’s possible to extend the lifespan of a game and keep it alive for many years with proper support, so we are likely to opt for long-term support.  
  
Changes to The Netherworld
--------------------------

  
But that's not all! We've also made some changes to how certain game mechanics work, which will be included in version 1.0, thanks to feedback from a few players who had access to the latest version of the game.  
  
The Cataclysm Runs, which previously only served to unlock the associated Warlords, now have an added functionality that increases replayability for these modes.  
  
Each Cataclysm Run now allows you to target a Pure Stat, which will have a higher chance of loot and a better score. The Pure Stats assigned to a Cataclysm change randomly at the end of each run.  
  
Additionally, we’ve changed how Nether items are obtained. You’ll now need to fill a Nether Charge bar by completing Cataclysm Runs in order to maximize the chances of looting a Nether item when facing a Warlord.  
  
We still have a number of changes and adjustments planned for release, but we’re making progress!

That's about it for now!  
Cheers!
