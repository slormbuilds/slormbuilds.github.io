Hello everyone!   
  
We took some time off with friends and family and to charge up batteries for the year ahead and we're now ready and excited to get work done and share new things with you! And to officially wish you a Happy New Year!  
  
We want to start off the year and this Chronicle with a very important announcement:  
  
The Slormancer sold 100.000 units on Steam!
===========================================

And this is absolutely phenomenal for us. Our optimistic goal for the first year was to sell about 15.000 units, and this felt ambitious, as this is our first game and because it is an Early Access after all.  
This is an incredible achievement for the both of us, and it could never have happened without the support of each and every player that trusted us by buying our game in its most basic (and bugged) Early Access version. So THANK YOU for your support.  
  
That being said, we still have lots of work to get to the 1.0, and if anything, this made us even more motivated to make The Slormancer the best game it can be.  
  
Work in Progress
================

  
We're still working on Part 1 of The Mage Academy update, which includes, among other things, new Slorm Reapers and new enemies. You can read more about our upcoming schedule and upcoming content on our previous [Slormite Chronicles](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1104280/view/3142946404922385298).   
We're now done with the new Slorm Reapers and are currently in the production step of new enemies, we just don't have anything to show yet. So what about a new Slorm Reaper ?

This is the "**Primordial Reaper of Alpha and Omega**". If you like massive orbs moving around, then this is a perfect fit for you.  
  
We've mentioned new ways of unlocking Slorm Reapers in our previous Chronicle. Well, there's a new Slorm Reaper called "**Pure Reaper of the Keeper**", that you can only get if you progress deep enough inside the Slorm Temple.   
I'd like to keep the complete effect for ourselves for now, but we can show the minion that comes with it. We call it the Mini-Keeper.

The Mini-Keeper is a minion that can be turned into a Totem on demand, benefiting from both Minion and Totem synergies and increasing its effect. It's strong. And we think it looks nice.  
  
That's it for now. We're still hoping to get that update out before the end of January. It'll depend on the amount of work we forgot to take into account. :)  
  
Have a nice day everyone!
