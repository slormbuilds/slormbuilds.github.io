Hello everyone!  
Welcome to The Slormite Chronicles #42!   
  
Since the last Slormite Chronicles, we've published The Balance Update on the Live Branch and it got a great reception considering the huge amount of changes that's been made.   
  
Taking the time to polish the Balance Update on the Experimental Branch for a couple of months to fix and balance a bunch of things that we've missed or overlooked was definitely the way to go, and a much smoother release experience for us. And this is something that we will want to reproduce.  
  
And as mentioned, we've also increased the price from $14.99 to $19.99. That being said, as soon as we reach the end of Early Access, we will move on to bigger sales than our usual 20%. So if you're waiting for a good opportunity to get into The Slormancer, just wait a little longer.  
  
The Final Update and leaving Early Access
-----------------------------------------

  
I've seen a couple of questions regarding our next update, so I'll try to clarify it here:  
The Warlords Update will be our Final Early Access Update and will actually be released as part of our 1.0 Release. This means that everything that is currently waiting on our Road Map will be added for this Update. This includes:  
* The Final Boss
* A Level Cap increased to 100
* Part III of Adam Nostrus' Trials
* The Warlords Endgame Mode
* The Influence System
* A total of 200 Legendary Items

And of course, quite a bit of bug fixes and balance changes. And on top of that, a proper translation for about 8-10 additional languages along with completing the ones that are already in the game.  
  
The downside is that we will also prepare our release with quite a bit of marketing so it will take some time to get everything done, but now that we're so close to the end, we really don't want to mess things up!  
  
The Warlords
------------

  
As mentioned in our latest [Slormite Chronicles](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1104280/view/4592070813170478316), we've been working on The Warlords, our final endgame mode. We want it to be a mode with a great sense of progression, instead of the usual "Difficulty Climb" that we've offered.  
  
So the first thing we had to craft was a nice and fancy menu to display said progression. In The Warlords mode, the player will actually move on to The Slormancer's realm and defeat its armies and Warlords right there. It's currently called "The Netherworld" as I've yet to find a funky word with "Slorm" in it for this place.  
  
The Menu currently looks like this (as always, everything is subject to change):

Since we went for a map / conquest kind-of design, you will be able to open it in a larger window:

There currently are 45 Cataclysm Runs and 25 Warlords Runs.  
  
You will only have to defeat Cataclysm Runs once to unlock said Cataclysm in its highest Difficulty setting (called "Warlord" difficulty). And to challenge a Warlord, you will have to unlock its Cataclysms to try and defeat him.  
  
Every Run has a set Enemy Level and Wrath Difficulty, yet we want it to be accessible right after the end of the story so the difficulty will start quite slow and increase gradually. Once you've defeated the entire Netherworld, you will get access to The Primordial Netherworld.  
  
In The Primordial Netherworld, everything is set on the highest difficulty (Enemy Level 100, Wrath 10), but this is where the loot table of The Warlords get really interesting.

About the loot tables: Warlords have a set loot table (displayed on the Warlords menu) that is randomized everytime the player completes a Warlord run, so you will never have to defeat the same Warlord 10 times in a row if you're looking for a particular item.  
  
When defeating a Warlord, you will get to choose between 3 Legendary Items from its loot table. But if you've defeated a Primordial Warlord, you will have a chance to get Nether Items instead (more on that in our previous [Slormite Chronicles](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1104280/view/4592070813170478316)).  
  
New Cataclysms
--------------

  
To get to 45 Cataclysm Runs, we've had to add 15 new Cataclysms to The Slormancer. They've been implemented and offer quite a fresh experience. As mentioned before, we've also been reworking the most unfun Cataclysms of the game.  
  
For instance, Invulnerability now grants a great amount Shield every few seconds, instead of complete Invulnerability, so players have a chance to actively destroy it.  
  
Here are a few screenshots of the new ones:  
**Endless Fire** casts a neverending Fireball that is constantly following you.

**Seals of Blindness** reduce your Line of Sight when you walk over one.

**Shadow Clones** let enemies cast one or more attacks once they die.

That's about it for today!  
Cheers everyone and see you in the next one!
