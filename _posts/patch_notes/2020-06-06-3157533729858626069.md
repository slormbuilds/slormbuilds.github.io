Featuring loads of shiny Loot, tons of collectibles, countless hours of content, a frenetic gameplay and carefully crafted pixel art.  
  
  
**Key Features**
----------------

  
* **An irrational story!**
You were born with absolutely no skill whatsoever, and yet you find a way to be the last hope of the realm as the enigmatic Slormancer and his incompetent underling try to conquer the world once again. How great. But like your grandfather once told you: "You might not have the talent but you have the will."
* **Three unique Classes**
Unlock and master more than 200 unique Abilities, Upgrades and Passives for every class. Each active Ability has its own skill tree, allowing you to create unique combinations.
* **Harness the power of your Ancestral Legacy**
Choose your Legacy and inherit ancient powers among more than 150 Element-related Skills and Passives in the Ancestral Skill Tree.
Master Fire and summon powerful elementals, use Ice to freeze your foes, convoke Thunder and create massive storms, embrace the power of Light or make one with Shadow, it's up to you!
* **Unique Weapons**
120 unique and **game-changing** weapons available for every class. Each Slorm Reaper is a unique and priceless weapon that you can loot during your adventure. Once found, wield it to benefit from its powerful effect, level it up, and eventually evolve it to a greater form.
* **Endless quest for Epic Loot!**
Find and collect normal, magic, rare and epic items with completely random properties but also shiny legendary items with more than 80 unique affixes.
Then enhance them with an **infinite** upgrade system!
* **Collect and Progress**
Unlock Skills, Upgrades and Ancestral Abilities, find epic items, and collect Slorm Reapers to create deadly combinations that suits your own play style!
The Slormancer is all about **Collection and Progression** so you can switch at any point between any skills you’ve previously unlocked, Slorm Reapers and items you’ve previously found, even between the 3 classes of the game! This unique **Flexibility** allows you to swap between different combinations and play styles in the blink of an eye, whenever you feel like it.
* **Procedural Adventures!**
Defeat lots of unique monsters, elites and bosses with more than 40 different affixes through procedurally generated adventures and hunt down The Slormancer’s Warlords through 7 different **upgradable** environments. There are always things to do and monsters to kill! And it's always different!
