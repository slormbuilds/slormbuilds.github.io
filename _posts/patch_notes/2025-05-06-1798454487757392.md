Hello everyone!  
Welcome to Slormite Chronicles #49!  
  
Not much to announce this week.  
  
  
Oh wait… Our game is leaving Early Access in 7 days.  
Other than that, everything’s pretty chill.  
  
We're cool.   
  

The Slormancer: From 0.1 To 1.0
-------------------------------

  
Have you seen those beautiful videos we made?   
They're 100% homemade and crafted with love. So, I'm dropping them here again, for no real reason, other than the fact that they're just nice. (Please share them)

Leaving Early Access!
---------------------

  
This will be the last Slormite Chronicle we publish while in Early Access. With this entry, I've written 49 Chronicles in total, meaning we'll start our 1.0 journey with Slormite Chronicle #50, which is pretty nice.  
  
Our Early Access journey didn’t always go as planned, and it ended up taking twice as long as we initially expected. But those expectations were based on zero prior experience, so in hindsight… it kind of makes sense.  
  
The Slormancer is far from perfect. It’s a bit odd in places, not always well-balanced, and still rough around some edges, but making a solid ARPG is a real challenge, especially for two amateur devs trying to find their way.  
  
We didn’t set out to make the ultimate ARPG. At first, we just wanted to build something we’d enjoy playing ourselves. But things grew, and suddenly we were trying to make a game that could speak to a much wider audience, from casual players to hardcore fans, which isn’t easy at all.  
  
That said, we truly hope that the love and effort we put into this project is visible. If The Slormancer manages to offer a fun, slightly quirky experience that resonates with some ARPG fans out there then we’ll consider that a big win.  
  

About the future
----------------

  
The 1.0 release is not the end of the journey. We still have plenty of ideas and plans to keep expanding The Slormancer. Even though the game is leaving Early Access, our commitment to it, and to our community, remains intact.  
  
We've decided to leave Early Access because the game is now feature-complete and relatively bug-free. That said, our day-to-day work won't change much, we'll still be fixing bugs, reworking systems, and adding new content.  
  
I still genuinely enjoy coding new features, coming up with fresh mechanics, and even writing these Slormite Chronicles. As long as that passion lasts (and as long as it remains financially sustainable) we’ll keep developing new content with the same enthusiasm.  
  
I’m not going to make any promises or give any exact details, because if everything goes smoothly, we might take a little break over the summer. That said, in the near (or not-so-near) future, we’ll be sharing a roadmap with upcoming features we'd like to add to The Slormancer.  
  

Thank you!

The Slormancer is the result of countless hours of work but it was made possible thanks to the incredible support, feedback, and passion of our player community throughout its development. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for being part of this adventure!  
  
I want to personally thank a few members of the community who have been absolutely amazing throughout Early Access. We truly have a great community.  
  
**Peredur**, for being with us since 2019, proofreading 49 Slormite Chronicles and numerous announcement posts. Also, thank you for suggesting the Steam Games Festival, I believe that’s where we found our first taste of success.  
  
**Cayrac**, for creating the fantastic and incredibly useful tool: [The Slorm Planner](https://cayrac.github.io/slorm-planner/build/inventory).  
  
**Legrems**, for providing valuable feedback, beta testing, writing helpful guides, and moderating our Discord community since 2021.  
  
**Ninakoru**, for taking the time to dive into my code, offering suggestions for fixes, and providing a wealth of constructive feedback.  
  
**Alarack**, for asking insightful questions and for single-handedly keeping our Discord active for a full year prior to Early Access. We still have the [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Np9p5sRYpQcvjIFDdlWUyM_CCdug_KxkrFE91TkWXhc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.860zkqjmpxm4) with all your questions. I haven’t revisited it in a while, so I wonder how relevant our answers are now!  
  
To our entire **Discord** community, who’ve followed us for the past 5 years with incredible passion.  
  
I also want to extend a huge thank you to everyone who contributed feedback, reported bugs, playtested broken versions of The Slormancer, helped others, and/or actively participated in the community, among which: **Akezhar, Al\_3x, Blacksad, Blitzy, Bodeln, Calavontis, DaddyDeGrand, Darkvoras, DenOwl, DevilsAdvocate, Doghouse, Dylan, Entity, faraddox, kechop3000, llli1liliill, MrPoirot, MuffinRichter, Nightxwolf, Ninakoru, NxHunter, Sawyer, Setharial, Silversicer, TasakaSama, Tengu, TheConcepteur, TheHobomice, Torinux, Twing, Vil, Wiffle, Yeljerolis**.  
  
To all the amazing content creators who helped spread the word about The Slormancer, like **Wanderbots** and **SplatterCatGaming**, **Pohx**, **ZiggyD**, **Dr3adful** as well as our beloved Frenchies, **Best In Slot**, **Bestio**, and **Hopure**, thank you for your support and enthusiasm.  
  
To **Abiding Bridge,** for handling the legal and administrative side of things, and for helping us form meaningful partnerships that made our journey easier and more focused.  
  
  
Since The Slormancer wouldn’t be what it is today without your help, it only felt right to include all of you in the credits of the game. It’s not much, but it’s the least we can do.  
  
I truly apologize if I've missed anyone, I did my best to include everyone I could think of.   
  
And finally, to **Aurélien Poudat**, the composer behind The Slormancer’s soundtrack, thank you for creating what I truly believe is one of the best video game OSTs I’ve ever heard. Your music has helped shape the soul of our universe.  
  
That's about it.  
See you all in a week!
