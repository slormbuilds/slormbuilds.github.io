Hello Everyone!  
  
If you've missed the last Slormite Chronicles then here's a quick recap: We are currently working on Update 0.8 that will introduce Achievements, a Codex and various quality of life features regarding stats and mechanics to The Slormancer,  
  
Update 0.8: Achievements and Codex
----------------------------------

  
You can read more about Achievements and Codex in our previous [Slormite Chronicles](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/4031353167277495724). Quickly put, we're introducing over 200 Achievements and a Codex, detailing most mechanics, stats and game modes of The Slormancer.

Working on Performance
----------------------

  
Besides the Codex and Achievements, we wanted to work on one last thing for this Update before calling it ready: Since the beginning of our Early Access, The Slormancer has struggled with performance toward the endgame when using heavy builds against lots of enemies. And this has only gone worse since the release of The Great Forge and then even worse when we allowed to fight multiple waves at once, coming from multiple directions. So you guessed it, we've been working on Performance.  
  
We're trying to get rid of any sort of slowdown or freeze and to maintain FPS at a good enough rate regardless of the situation you're in. Hopefully, this is our final work on performance, and once we're done, The Slormancer will be ready for 1.0 performance-wise.  
  
I've recorded a Before / After using a VERY intensive build in which I have about 100% Critical Strike Chance and 50% Ancestral Strike Chance, resulting in lots of Ancestral Effects triggering on top of constant Burn ticks everywhere. I'm also using Echoes of Vilinis, which can be quite demanding (to say the least) when lots of Crits are occuring. It's quite a messy build yet it's much cleaner when it stops being a slideshow.

We've done incredible improvements by reworking pretty much every script that are heavily used in combat, whether by your own Character and Skills or by Enemies. We've also changed the way the game is compiled, again gaining quite a bit of speed.  
  
I'm happy to say that improvements are satisfying enough to the point that we now feel confident with the performances of the game. That being said, some very specific builds may still be slowing the game down, but these will now be easy to target and work on.  
  
Release when?!
--------------

  
That's where we're at. At this point, it is safe to say that the **0.8 Update** should be available before the end of **March**, unless we run into some big issues during our final tests.   
  
We've been working on mostly technical stuff for the past month so this is not the most exciting Chronicle, and we don't have much to share. But we believe it's for the best!  
  
Cheers!
