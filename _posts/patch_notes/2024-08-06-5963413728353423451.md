Hello everyone!  
It's that day of the month!   
  
The Balance Update
------------------

  
So, as you may have read in previous Slormite Chronicles, we've been monitoring The Balance Update (0.9), currently available on the Experimental Branch, that introduced a LOT of changes (Read the [Patch Notes](https://www.slormitestudios.com/patch_0_9_0.php) here). Since its release, we've made at least a couple of rounds of changes that can be found under the [Changelog](https://www.slormitestudios.com/patch_0_9_0.php#changelog) part.  
  
We're pretty happy with how everything is turning out and are almost done with Balance changes (at least for this update, of course). This means that The Balance Update will soon hit the Live Branch and will be available to everyone.  
  
If you want to read more about The Balance Update, check out:

[Slormite Chronicles #39](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/4264427597952925408)  
  
And of course: [The Patch Notes](https://www.slormitestudios.com/patch_0_9_0.php)  
  
I've said this before, but if you want to try the update of The Experimental Branch, it will copy your progress from the Live Branch and you will later be able to keep playing on that save as soon as the Balance Update hits the Live Branch, so you can try it out without losing your progress at any point.  
  
The Final Update
----------------

  
The Final Update, as found in the Road Map, will include:  
* A new endgame mode: The Warlords.
* The end of the Story.
+ Adam Nostrus' Trials Part III.
+ The Final Boss.

* About 120 Legendary Effects (to get to 200).
* A Level Cap increased to 100.

This Update should take us about 2 to 3 months, however this is the update that puts an end to Early Acces and that marks the release of The Slormancer in 1.0. This means that we will have quite a bunch of stuff to do before releasing this update, and the game.  
  
This also includes translating The Slormancer in various languages but more importantly, this includes a big marketing campaign to be sure that we make as much noise as possible when we release the game. This as well, should take a couple of months.  
  
This will be a crucial moment for The Slormancer so we will have to be very careful with how we handle the release and pick a good release window.  
We have a release date in mind but that's still too early to tell.  
  
While preparing the release, we will also be moving The Final Update to a Closed Beta branch so that it can be thoroughly tested before going on the Live Branch.  
  
Legendary Effects
-----------------

  
We've already started working on The Final Update and now have a complete list of 120 new Legendary Items, that now need to be properly implemented into the game.  
  
Unfortunately, they are currently in a huge sheet so I have nothing to screenshoot and share.  
Here's a quick teaser though: We've added Legendary Effects for each Class so that there is at least one Legendary Effect for each Mechanic / Skill and we've also added about 20 Legendary Effects regarding the Ancestral Legacy.   
  
Now here's something new that we've had in mind for quite a while: We're adding a few Legendary Effects for Slorm Reapers. The idea is to boost some Slorm Reapers that need one or more extra effects to make them work.  
  
Price Change
------------

  
Now that The Slormancer is almost in its final form, we believe that it is no longer correctly priced and we will increase its price by about 25%, altough we're still not quite sure about the final price yet.  
  
We've had our share of Negative Reviews, and we've had feedback on about every single aspect of the game, yet I don't think we've ever seen a Negative Review regarding the price, which is a great. And despite this increase, we would love to keep it this way.   
  
This change will occur in September after our next Slormite Chronicles.   
This is only a first notification.  
  
That being said, The Slormancer will be on sales as often as possible, including on its release week so if you haven't bought the game yet, do not feel rushed to buy it now.   
  
That's about it for today!  
Cheers!
