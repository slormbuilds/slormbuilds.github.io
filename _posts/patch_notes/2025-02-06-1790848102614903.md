Hello everyone!  
  
Welcome to this month' Slormite Chronicles!   
As we get closer to the release, it gets harder to talk about new and exciting content because we've already covered what The Final Update (1.0) will be about in previous Slormite Chronicles ([#41](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/4592070813170478317), [#42](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/4686648941185573051), [#43](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/4463723296443073307) and [#44](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/4480614335784159155)). The development of The Slormancer is almost over. We're making a few tweaks, adding a few assets here and there and that's about it. We've shifted toward marketing the game and catching as much attention as we can until the release.  
  
We have a release window in mind but we won't be able to talk about it right now. So except from that, I'll try to be as transparent as possible with how things are going:  
  

Playtesting The Final Update
----------------------------

  
With 120+ new Legendary Items, Nether Equipment, a new Endgame mode and new Cataclysms coming up, we have to make sure that The Final Update is as good and as bugfree as it can be.  
For this reason, we will be opening up The Experimental Branch by the end of **February** for everyone to try this update. Stay tuned!  
  
***-Edited February 28-**  
For everyone waiting for the experimental branch to open in order to try the latest update—we promised it would be available by the end of February.   
Unfortunately, we've decided not to proceed with it.  
  
After careful consideration and internal discussions, we realized that splitting the player base across multiple small releases could hurt the momentum of the official 1.0 update. We may be overthinking it, but we truly believe this is the right decision for the game in the long run.  
  
We're really sorry about this. We were eager to share our progress with the community but didn’t fully consider the bigger picture.  
  
We’ll take the time to explain our reasoning and detail our release plans in the next Slormite Chronicles.   
An experimental branch will still open before the full release—just with better timing.*  
  

Changes and Fixes
-----------------

  
Let's start with the game itself. We've been making a small balance pass regarding the biggest complaints from the community that resulted in the following changes:  
  
**The Great Forge !**  
Being defeated in The Great Forge will now cause you to lose all multipliers and War Chests bonuses but you will get to loot your War Chest anyway.  
  
This is a big change, but we can definitely agree that losing in The Great Forge can be really painful so we feel like it's for the best.  
  
**Achievements**  
Some of the initial values on Achievements were too damn high!   
So we're adjusting those.  

* Elite Slayer Rank 5 has been reduced from 100 000 to 10 000.
* Equipment Finder Rank 5 has been reduced from 100 000 to 2 500.
* Achievements requiring you to complete X Floors in a specific Environment have been reduced at rank 5 from 1 000 to 250.

  
**Potential**  
Potential gets increasingly harder when an Item reaches high levels of Reinforcement to a point that it farming to get Potential is no longer a viable option. For this reason, players often bypass Potential by using currencies.   
  
This is fine but we would like for the farming option to be much more viable. As much we've made a few adjustments to the Potential curve resulting in a reduction of about 85% for an Item with a Reinforcement Level of 15.  
  
  
We've been making other changes and will probably make a few more before the release. These have been the changes we've been working on this month.  
  

Advertising The Slormancer
--------------------------

  
This is something that we haven't been doing a lot during Early Access but that is necessary to spread the word. We've started publishing content on various platforms. If you wish to, you can follow us on:  

* [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@slormite_studios)
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXZsGPtWgQMS33DcH3R52ZA)
* [X / Twitter](https://x.com/SlormiteStudios)
* [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/slormitestudios.bsky.social)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SlormiteStudios/)
* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/slormite_studios)

We're also working on various materials to give our Steam Page a fresh look, such as an updated Trailer or a new Thumbnail Image.   
  

Localization
------------

  
We're currently working with a publisher to translate the game in various languages. We've stated this before, The Slormancer is pretty heavy when it comes to word count, so translations can get quite expensive so we have to carefully pick the languages we want.  
  
Right now, we've been using the number of Wishlists we have in every language to determine the highest demands. The Slormancer will be availabe at launch in the following languages:  

* English
* French
* Chinese
* Traditional Chinese
* Japanese
* German
* Spanish
* Russian

Depending on how the release goes and how our sales and wishlists evolve, we will try to progressively add new languages to The Slormancer. If you would like to help us translate the game in a language that is not in the list above, please contact us and we will try to work something together.  
  

Console Release
---------------

  
On top of that, we're working to get The Slormancer on consoles (PS5, Switch and X-Box X for now). We're not looking for a simultaneaous release for PC and consoles, but it's on the way!  
  
That's about it for now!  
Cheers!
