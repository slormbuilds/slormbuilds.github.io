Hello everyone!  
  
This patch hopefully fixes all bugs that were found during Act II and/or that were preventing players from progressing.  
  
- Fixed a bug preventing you to properly loot Grotagrom's belt and give it to Adam Nostrus to get the 3rd Ancestral Stone. If it happened to you, Adam Nostrus should have a new dialogue for you.  
  
- Fixed an issue preventing players from unlocking The Slorm Temple. If it happened to you, Olorin should have a new dialogue. Simply talk to him to trigger the proper events.  
  
- Fixed an issue preventing players from completing some missions such as Act II's Mission 5.  
  
Grotagrom's Fight:  
- Grotagrom can no longer be stunned by your own skills.  
- Grotagrom should no longer freeze and remain stuck if you deal damage to him while he comes down.  
**- We added hints before and during the fight so the mechanic is easier to figure out.**  
  
The Slorm Temple:  
- The Floor Cap has been increased.  
- You can no longer start the Slorm Temple if you don't have enough Elder Slorm using a controller.  
  
*Regarding the Slorm Temple, we are aware that Upgrades currently get way too expansive and we plan to address that in an upcoming patch.*  
  
That should be it for today.  
More to come later!
