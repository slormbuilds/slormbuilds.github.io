Hello everyone!  
  
This patch is mostly about fixing the biggest Performance issues occuring inside The Great Forge.  
There are a couple of things that were fixed along the way such as Slorm Reaper Affinity and Enhancement Runes not working.  
  
Once I've dealt with the most important issues, I'll upload anohter patch and write a proper Patch Notes listing all the changes.  
Tomorrow most likely.  
  
I hope you're all having a good time!  
Cheers!
