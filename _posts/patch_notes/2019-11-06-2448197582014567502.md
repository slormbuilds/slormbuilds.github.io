Hello everyone!  
  
From now on, we're going to try to keep you updated on what we are working on. This time, we are revealing a new layer of customization called the "Ancestral Legacy", which is a Skill Tree that is common to every class of the game.   
  
In the Ancestral Legacy tree, you will find 51 Active Skills and Auras, 49 Element-Related Effects or Triggers and 50 General Passives for a total of 150 nodes, and room for more.   
  
**The Ancestral Legacy Tree:**

The Ancestral Legacy tree is heavily oriented toward Elemental Magic and new mechanics that can be added to your class' Skills such as setting your weapon on Fire to deal Burn Damage or triggering Thunderbolts when dealing Critical Damage .  
  
It is divided in 5 big chunks: Fire, Ice, Lightning, Shadow and Light. General passives and actives can be found everywhere on the tree.  
  
Each Element has its own set of mechanics and has unique visual effects.  
Here are a few old tweets that are still relevant:

[Ice Example - Creating an Ice Storm](https://twitter.com/SlormiteStudios/status/1106894188187131905)  
  
[Lightning Example - Becoming a Sith](https://twitter.com/SlormiteStudios/status/1109488535462133761)

If you're not a huge fan of fancy and colorful Elemental stuff, there are also lots of neutral passives and actives that you can build with or around.  
  
  
**The In-game Menu:**

There are two main things that the player can do on this menu:  
1/ The player can activate an area (the circles above, containing up to three skills) by socketing an Ancestral Stone to it. The area has to be connected to a previously activated area.  
2/ The player can invest Slorm in skills inside an activated area to unlock their effects and upgrade them.  
  
Socketing an Ancestral Stone is free and can be done at any time on the fly. You can also unsocket Ancestral Stones. When you do so, you lose the effects of the skills/passives inside, and the ability to upgrade them, until you decide to socket your Stone back again.  
  
In The Slormancer, Slorm is infinite: as long as you slay enemies, you will gain Slorm.  
This means that you can actually upgrade every skill of the Skill Tree without restriction if you want to. What creates your actual build are the areas you decide to activate with your Ancestral Stones, because their number is limited.  
  
This lets the player discover and invest into new skills without having to worry about making mistakes or having to refund/reset his build later on. You can also collect every skill of the Skill Tree if you want to.  
  
  
**Bonus:**  
This is how the Ancestral Legacy used to look like before. It was much smaller in terms of depth and customization, that's why we decided to change it. It wasn't perfect but was still super fun to use.

That's it for now!
