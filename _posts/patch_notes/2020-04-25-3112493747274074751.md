Hello everyone! Sorry for the delay between devlogs, we're getting close to the Early Access stage of the game so we are (a bit too much) focused on getting things done and we sometimes forget about people that actually care about the development of the game.  
  
Lately we've been focusing on improving the overall experience of the game, we've added a bunch of Quality of Life features, things that were not needed but that were fun to do for us and that felt like a nice addition. Here are a couple of examples:  
  
Quality of Life Features
========================

  
**Featured Quality of Life #1: Pixel Font**  
You now have the option to switch between a standard and a Pixel font in-game.   
  
We know some people really prefer pixel fonts in Pixel Art games (it's also my personal preference in our game) but we also have a text-heavy game with lots of skills descriptions and tooltips so we had to have a smooth and readable font (in which Pixel fonts do not shine).  
  
Here is the Profile Menu (a brand new menu by the way) with and without a Pixel Font.

**Featured Quality of Life / #2: Highlighting stats**  
So we wanted to slightly improve the overall experience of a player that is looking for a specific stat / set of stats on items. So we've added a small option: in your inventory, you can now click on the stat(s) you wish to highlight and they will appear in a different color on your items, making it easier to find items that might be of interest for your current build.

On this Screen, the "Evasion" stat is highlited.  
This is a small addition but it is super useful actually.  
  
  
Polished Feedback
=================

  
Some elements in the game needed a bit of an upgrade and felt slightly below the rest.  
For example, we updated the Level Up screen/message. The old message was really basic and clearly underwhelming compared to what Leveling up is supposed to feel.  
  
The new Level Up screen:

The Old Level Up:

Menus
=====

  
We've had to make/update a bunch of menus to go with some of are features. Here are a couple of examples:  
  
Score Screen: This is the screen you get when you complete an Expedition (it's just a screenshot (duh!), the result ingame is full of fancy animations).  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/c154d3efe038e8f9f1dd7b846d406c382eddb1ca)  
  
  
Area Overview: In The Slormancer, you gain "Influence" in every Environment you visit. And Influence lets you unlock Perks in these Areas: this is the Area Overview of The Graveyard.

Main Menu: And here is the Main Menu of The Slormancer. Everything is animated ingame but this gives an idea of the actual look. :D

Steam Game Festival
===================

  
One very important note (for us at least), a demo of The Slormancer will be playable during between June 9 and June 14 during the Steam Games Festival. We are incredibly excited to get feedback on the game. So please make sure to give it a try and share your comments on our Discord channel.   
  
That's it for now! We'll be back sooner next time!
