Hello everyone!  
  
Behold! The Patch Notes for The Balance Update (0.9) is here!  
  
**The Balance Update (0.9) itself is not out yet and will be available in a couple of weeks**, once we're done with our internal testing and once we're happy with the Patch Notes below.  
  
This is the first version and we'll be happy to read your feedback on it.  
You can either react below this post or on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tkYxSuB).  
  
The Patch Notes is too big to be posted here on Steam so it is hosted on our website.
