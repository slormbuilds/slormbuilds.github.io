Hello everyone!  
  
We've been trying to get the update out before Halloween but it just wasn't enough time to get everything done. That being said, everything is now ready and the last touches are being added so we can safely give you a release date.  
  
The Prison Update will go live on **November 8th**!
---------------------------------------------------

  
So in about a week, depending on when you read this announcement. ːsteamhappyː

We'll post the full patch note a couple of days before in the upcoming Slormite Chronicle.  
  
This is our largest update to this day and we sincerely hope to have created a fresh and fun experience for everyone, so we're both nervous and excited to get it out and get your feedback!  
  
In the meantime, Happy Halloween everyone!
