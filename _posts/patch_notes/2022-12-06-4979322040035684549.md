Hello everyone! It's Chronicle Time!  
  
If you've been following The Slormancer, you know that our last update was "The Luxuriant Update Part I" so naturally, our next update will be "The Luxuriant Update Part II".  
  
As mentioned on the Road Map, "The Luxuriant Update Part II" will include:  

* A New Act: New Missions and a new Boss fight.
* A New Ancestral Legacy Tree Tier.
* An Increased Level Cap.

  
  

Act IV
======

  
Act IV is in progress. 8 new missions are being added to the game, followed by a glorious boss fight!  
  
When we create new missions, our goal is to build something that cannot be found in regular procedurally generated Expeditions, so we try to toy with the possibilites of the environment. So you can expect gardens filled of fountains or ponds or anything we could think of.  
  
In the Luxuriant Gardess, we tried to build a few missions around the maze and the possibilities that it offers without, hopefully, creating tedious missions.  
  
We are adding a new Quality of Life -sort of- mechanic: When you complete a mission, you will now be able to move on to the next mission without having to come back to the village everytime.  
  
Unless an event has to trigger in the village to forward the story, in which case, this won't be an option.  
We will add this mechanic for Act IV missions for now, and add it to previous acts at some point as well.

Once you clear Act IV, you will get your usual Ancestral Stone from Adam Nostrus which leads me to our next part.  
  

New Ancestral Legacy Tier
=========================

  
This new Ancestral Stone will give you access to **32 new Ancestral Skills**.  
  
Here are a few examples of the new Skills you will have access to:  
  

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ![](/assets/patch_notes/9d5556b2c70069d10fea65f664507a78b396b3f8) | **Spark Machine**: Aura - While this Aura is toggled on, you constantly create Electric Sparks dealing [15% Elemental Damage] to random enemies nearby. |
| ![](/assets/patch_notes/aabc8b75087f6b92918cbd0885159c43b2b7b4a8) | **Wavering Glow**: When they disappear, Shield Globes you did not pick up now grant you a shield equal to 25% of their shield value. |
| ![](/assets/patch_notes/c86638a3f45056759a31b849d910fca47c0b977c) | **Inextinguishable Light**: Active Skill - For the next 6 seconds, your Life cannot be reduced below 1. |
| ![](/assets/patch_notes/bb21486ce10920a3c59dcebaf38ecd6a17dd2836) | **Melting Ice**: Your Ancestral Strikes reset the Cooldown of your Ancestral Legacy Active Skills. |
| ![](/assets/patch_notes/f02d241f142601098d8294a7523a6a9888c8623c) | **More Fire**: Burn can now stack up to 7 times. |

  
  
  

Increased Level Cap
===================

  
And finally, the Level Cap will go up to 70.  
After that, there will be another increase going up to Level 80 during The Royal Update Part II and a final increase to Level 100 for The Final Update and the end of Early Access.

Various Reworks on the way
==========================

  
We are also working on various reworks.   
These may or may not make it to the next Update depending on how much time we have left, but they are on top of our to-do list:  

* **Controller Rework**: We want to improve the overall experience in gameplay by allowing players to have control over the auto-targetting system and improve the feeling as much as possible.
We also want to almost entirely rework how menus are being handled with a controller. We don't want to make a separate interface for controller users but I have quite a bit of room for improvement. And probably switch to cursor-based menus.  
* **Armor / Elemental Resistance / Evasion**: We want to rework the system so that these stats become a bit more central to most builds and try to make them as useful as Life, or even more depending on your playstyle. Basically we want them to be stronger. :)
Armor and Elemental Resistance Penetration should be impacted by the changes we intend to make as well and will most likely become much more useful stats.  
* **Balance**: We are currently looking at balancing game-breaking effects and effects that allow you to completely bypass the intended difficulty, and these should be adressed in the next Update.

  
  
I believe this is the shortest Slormite Chronicles to this day. Our previous update is 3 weeks old, and since we are currently focusing on short and frequent updates, there's nothing super big or fancy coming up that we can share.   
  
  
That's about it.  
Have a nice day everyone!
