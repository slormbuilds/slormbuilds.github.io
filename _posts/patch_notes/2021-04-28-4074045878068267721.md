Hello everyone!  
  
Another patch to fix bugs, and hopefully black screen issues and/or freezes.  
  
Performances:  
Hoverall, the game should be much friendlier to low-specs Graphic Cards.  
If you had Black Screen problems and freezes since last patch, they should be resolved.  
If not, let me know.  
  
I mostly spent time working on these issues, so not a lot of other changes today.   
  
Generals:  
- Damages to Elites should now be displayed properly  
  
The Mighty Knight:  
- Vengeance is best served cold should now work properly (and should work fine with Mastering Retaliation)  
- Elder Armor should now display changes without having to reequip your armor  
  
The Fierce Huntress:  
- Auto-Aim System should now properly work with multiple projectiles  
  
Legendaries:  
- Soul Eating Mantle now works with Whirlwind  
- Soul Eating Mantle no longer works with Arcane Breach (Not a Channeled or Damage over Time skill)  
- Aestia's Ring of Life's Cooldown should now only start when the effect is over  
- Aestia's Ring of Mana's Cooldown should now only start when the effect is over  
- Bulwark's Resolve should now display the correct value  
  
Reapers:  
- Reaper of the Manabender should now trigger Mana Detonation only with its Primordial form  
- Manabender's Cooldown should now only start when the effect is over  
- Vindictive Slam should now be properly triggered be split or forked Projectiles  
- Reaper of the Vindictive Slam's Holy Ground should now deal the proper damage (from 10% to 30%)  
- Reaper of the Nimble Warrior should now work properly when 0 damage is dealt  
  
Elements:  
- Burning Trail's debuff icon should no longer blink  
  
Attributes:  
- Zeal 15: now properly refers to "Skills" instead of "spells"  
- Willpower 45: now properly counts Wandering Arrow as a Minion  
- Bravery 30: You should no longer gain Greed stack when unequipping gear
