Hello everyone!  
Welcome to a very special edition of the Slormite Chronicles!  
  
Since a lot of new players have joined us recently, here’s a quick reminder: the Slormite Chronicles is what we call our devlogs. We publish one on the 6th of every month to celebrate the day The Slormancer launched in Early Access.  
  
But hey, we didn’t want to wait until the 6th this time. So here’s a little bonus Chronicles to give you a quick recap of how launch week went, and what’s coming up next!  
  

What a Week!
------------

  
Launch week officially ends on Tuesday, May 20th at 7pm (which is just a few hours from the time I’m writing this). And overall… it went pretty well!  
  
We sold **75,000** copies during launch week, bringing us to a grand total of **250,000** units sold! Thank you so much for your support!

Our only previous experience with a game launch was when The Slormancer hit Early Access, and let’s just say, that was a bit more of a wild ride.   
  
We’ve seen dozens of bugs reported daily on Discord, but players are still able to launch the game and enjoy the full content without major crashes. The #1 issue seems to be the game starting in windowed mode, mildly annoying, but fixable on the player's end.  
  
We also hit an all-time peak of **10,989** concurrent players!  
That’s not quite at the level of the genre’s biggest titles, but considering where we started, and the fact that our team has a grand total of two people, we think that’s pretty awesome.

Once again, a massive thank you to everyone who gave the game a shot this week, whether you loved it or bounced off, we appreciate every single one of you.  
  
Unlike our Early Access launch, we’re also seeing a lot more players sticking around this time, which is super encouraging. There’s content, and players seem to be enjoying it.  
  
Thanks to many streamers who jumped in and gave The Slormancer a try, we’ve regularly had between 1,000 and 4,000 viewers on Twitch. Big thanks to all the streamers and viewers, it's always fun watching new builds being discovered live.  
  
Here’s a handful of cool videos we'd like to share:

Handling Feedback
-----------------

  
We’ve had an avalanche of feedback to process: from Discord, Steam, emails, and beyond. Whether it’s bug reports or gameplay suggestions, we’re actually spending more time reading and sorting through it all than fixing things!  
  
So we’ve got to optimize how we work. Aside from two quick hotfixes to address crashes, I only just got back into the code yesterday, and I’ve been working full steam ahead to squash bugs and add a few goodies.  
  
That said, as mentioned, we’re a tiny team, and I’m actually the only developer. This whole adventure started with the two of us, and we’d really like it to end the same way, just us, doing our best to build something we care about. It’s just… a bit slower.  
  
**More feedback!**  
We’re also reading a ton of feedback all over the place, Reddit threads, Twitch chat, Steam discussions, and we’ve been feeling a lot of love lately.  
  
The Slormancer was made with passion, but let’s be honest, it’s a bit clumsy in places so we totally understand the negative reviews and that it might not click for everyone.   
  
That said, we’re really happy to see that some of the core ideas we had from the start, like instantly swapping builds or offering deterministic crafting, are being recognized and appreciated. That means a lot to us.  
  
**Speaking of feedback…**  
If you’re enjoying The Slormancer, please consider leaving a positive review! It really helps. ːbryan\_mcrippedː  
  

Patch When?
-----------

  
Post-release is a bit different from Early Access. My plan is to release regular patches with fixes and updates until everything’s stable and polished. The first patch should drop next week, and we’ll test it on the Experimental Branch for a few days to make sure it doesn’t break anything.  
  
Here’s a tiny sneak peek:  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/e78ec18f5faa19b8149799294808ebf3c619c297)  
*Added a visual cue to make it super clear you can only have one upgrade per tier.*  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/b9f5428e4553353c5cad57837e82e2ece084b1a1)  
*Added a shiny new button in the Forge.*  
  
We’ve also got a bunch of quality-of-life tweaks and loads of bug fixes coming.  
  
  

What’s Next?
------------

  
To be fully transparent, we’ve just wrapped up 8 years of development, with some very intense final months. I want to focus hard on fixing as many issues as I can during these early weeks, so everyone can enjoy the game under the best conditions.  
  
After that, we’ll take a bit of a breather and figure out the next steps. There are a lot of things we’d love to add, but until we’re 100% sure what’s feasible, we don’t want to make any promises.  
  
What I can promise, though, is this:  
The Slormancer is coming to consoles, Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox, when it’s ready. While adapting the UI for consoles, we’ll also be polishing up controller support and working toward getting that sweet “Verified” badge for the Steam Deck.  
  
That’s all for now!  
Thanks again to everyone playing, supporting, and slorm hunting with us!  
  
(Alright, back to code.)
