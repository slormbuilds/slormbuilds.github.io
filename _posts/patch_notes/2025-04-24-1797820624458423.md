[Here's a count down timer to the release](https://countingdownto.com/?c=6242688).  
  
Release Discount
----------------

  
The Slormancer will have its biggest discount yet: **25%** off during launch week.  
  
Experimental Branch
-------------------

  
For those of you eager to try The Slormancer 1.0, we will open an Experimental Branch available to everyone on **Tuesday, April 29**. The Experimental Branch will allow us to catch the few remaining bugs that may still be in the game and make sure that everything is up and ready for the release.  
  
We need your help!
------------------

  
As a small indie team, your support means the world to us. If you’ve enjoyed your time with The Slormancer, there are a few simple things you can do to help us make this release a success:  
* Tell your friends about the game, or share the news on social media!
* Leave a positive review on Steam if you haven’t already, it really helps more than you might think.
* Leave a comment or a thumbs up on either YouTube trailers and help spread the word!

Every little gesture counts and helps us bring The Slormancer to even more players.  
Thank you for being part of this wild adventure!  
  
Steam Achievements and Supporter Pack
-------------------------------------

  
Toward the end of the Experimental period, and in order to ensure that the player experience on the Experimental Branch is as close as possible to what it will be in version 1.0, we will be releasing all the remaining content we had yet to publish, namely: the Supporter Pack, Steam Achievements, as well as Steam Trading Cards and Community Badges.  
  
<https://store.steampowered.com/app/3625910/The_Slormancer__Supporter_Pack>  
  
The Supporter Pack should be available a few days before the 1.0 release but you can already wishlist it.  
On that day, we will also enable Steam Achievements, Steam Trading Cards and Community Badges so that we can make sure that everything is working properly.  
  
This is it!
