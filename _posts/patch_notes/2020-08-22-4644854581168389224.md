We've been working on The Slormancer for almost 4 years now and the 2 basic enemies (Skeleton Soldier and Skeleton Archer) have been here the whole time.  
So we were super excited to create new enemies for the game!  
  
We added a dozen of new enemies to The Slormancer, it's time for you to meet some of them!  
  
  
**Zombie Peasants**  
![](/assets/patch_notes/efe4351cad7df72bd4b2881b6e5dd7ff136c811b)  
*Weak alone but deadly in numbers. It applies the "Scratch" debuff to its target, doubling Zombie Peasant Damage for the next 30 seconds.*  
  
  
  
**The Plague Doctor**  
![](/assets/patch_notes/396350002ef613e27a934459fc1085b6c7165691)  
*The Plague Doctor spreads Poisonous Areas all over the Map while also moving out if you get too close. Dangerous if you let him live too long*  
  
  
  
**The COLOSSUS**  
![](/assets/patch_notes/a7e9060656548363501361ba38c05b4d34f84dd7)  
*The Dreadful Colossus deals Damage in Circles of various sizes when he slams the ground, better be careful. Also, never hide under its fists.*  
  
  
  
**Corrupted Puddings and Burning Puddings**  
![](/assets/patch_notes/9978e9a3f55dcda260a630d92f1b9cfe2dc928d9)  
*Corrupted Puddings create a Dangerous Area of Effect below you.*  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/b2f6da1f287e6f0e19648779b01db505b4263c32)  
*Burning Puddings cast Elemental Projectiles that follow you for a short period of time.*  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/a9cd55bc13aa5d5a9d1ec875dd8b96f863a09463)  
*Turn out these cute little guys are quite a threat.*  
  
  
  
**The Hex Shroud**  
![](/assets/patch_notes/a3912d29862b155cf71d13bf25d071e820b23d88)  
*The Hex Shroud applies a Curse decreasing Armor, Attack Speed or Movement Speed while dealing Damage over time to you if you are within its ever-expanding range.*  
  
  
  
**The Fallen Knight - Elite**  
The game also features Elite enemies. They are obviously quite stronger but also faster and smarter.  
Each Elite Enemy also has an additional behavior and/or an enhanced effect:  
Examples from enemies above:  
- Elite Zombie Peasant summons another Zombie Peasants whenever he hits you.  
- Elite Hex Shroud applies the 3 Curses at once.  
- Elite Corrupted Pudding's Area of Effects are recasted after a bit.  
  
You'll have to meet each and every Elite version to figure out their mechanic.  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/046a383bdaa86e10ee2b968aa812ef288be8869b)  
*An Elite Fallen Knight, with an Increased Range of Attack*
