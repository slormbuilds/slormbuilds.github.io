Hello everyone!   
  
We've pretty much revealed everything that is planned for the upcoming update in the previous [Slormite Chronicle](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1104280/view/3127189423521555235). There are a few things that we've implemented and that we haven't (or barely) mentionned so I'll try to cover that instead today, starting with a couple of informations about The Mage Academy itself.  
  
Act III : The Mage Academy
==========================

  
The next part of the story will take place in the Mage Academy, where you will have to find the Destroyer of Indestructible and Unbreakable Seals that Olorin, the Archmage, uses as a paperweight.   
  
There, you will have to fight dead yet deadly students of the four houses of the Mage Academy which is now under the control of no other than Olorin's evil twinâ€¦ Alarin.

*Witches from the 4 houses.*

*The Mage Academy can now be visited.*

*Alarin, signing out.*  
  
New NPC
=======

  
We're introducing a new NPC called Cory Ironbender, the last living Reapersmith, that you will be able to unlock throughout Act III. Unfortunately, he is retired.   
  
He will probably have a role to play in The Great Forge, The Slormancer's upcoming endgame mode.   
Who knows?

*Cory Ironbender, retired Reapersmith.*  
  
New Cataclysms
==============

  
We're introducing 7 new Cataclysms and 2 new Exaltations.  
The complete list will be revealed later. For now, here are a couple of examples:  
- "Replicant": Enemies summon a copy of themselves when they reach 50% Life.  
- "Gargantuan": Enemies are bigger and deal 200% Increased Damage until they receive damage.  
- "Assimilation": Enemies receive 15% Decreased Damage for each yard between them and the damage's source.

*Gargantuan effect (I died taking that screenshot).*  
  
New Breach Event
================

  
We've added a new way for Breaches to spawn enemies (so this is INSTEAD of getting 1, 2 or 3 waves of enemies) called the Chaos Wave.  
When triggered, the Chaos Wave spawns a few dozens of enemies, at an accelerating pace and with random compositions.  
The description doesn't do justice to this event, it's quite fun if I do say so myself. :)

When?
=====

  
We still have quite a bit of stuff we want to get done for this update (a skill to rework, a couple of mechanics to improve, Act I to rework and a few more things), and each element could take longer than anticipated so we feel like it's still too soon to give a precise timeframe. On top of that, adding elements to the story and new missions require a bit more testing that the usual.   
I'm pretty sure we unfortunately won't make it in time for march, so we'll rather try to get it out before the 1 year anniversary of the game (on April 6), but again, easier said than done.  
At the very least, you'll have a new Chronicle on that day with a release date. :x  
  
That's about it for this Chronicle.   
Have a nice sunday everyone!
