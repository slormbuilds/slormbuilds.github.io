Hello everyone!  
  
We're pleased to let everyone know that after developing this game since what feels like 1986, we finally have a release date for Early Access.

The hunt for The Slormancer will begin on **April 6**!  
And we are super excited to let everyone try the game.  
  
If you've missed the latest Trailer, now would be a great time to watch it!  
And a great time to watch it again, if you've seen it already!
