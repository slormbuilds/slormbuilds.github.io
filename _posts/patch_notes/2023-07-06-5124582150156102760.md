You can read more about most of the upcoming changes in [Slormite Chronicles #25](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/3719453992477321493) and [Slormite Chronicles #26](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/3721708329664648030).  
  
The Roadmap
===========

  
With this Update, we are done with most of the heavy / mandatory stuff and the future will allow us more flexibility. We still have quite a bunch of very important features coming up, but they are a very different aspect of the game than what we've been working on this past year (Enemies / Environment / Story / Missions) so we're pretty excited by this.

Our plan for the rest for the year 2023 is as follow:  
* Release **The Ancestral Update** and tie the Story to the Endgame.
* Release **68 New Slorm Reapers** to reach our target number of **120**.
* Release **The Warlords Update**: Our 4th Endgame mode.

Let me say this right now, Slorm Reapers can be REALLY hard to design so it is quite hard to determine how much time it will take. Above is what we have in mind, but if taking the time to create fun and interesting Slorm Reapers delays the release of the Warlord Update for a month, then so be it.  
  
Then 2024 will be about adding final features such as adding a Codex, Achievements etcâ€¦ We also want to rework classes and skills with the help of the community while balancing the whole content. And hopefully move on to 1.0.  
  
  
The Ancestral Update
====================

  
The Ancestral Update is next on the line.  
  
The goal of this Update is to link the end of the Story that you will get to discover on Monday's update (The Royal Wing Update, Part II) to the Endgame. And altough everything I'm about to say is subject to change, this is roughly what is planned for this update:  
* Adam Nostrus will give the players that just completed the story a good introduction to what can be done in the endgame. We currently call this "**Adam Nostrus' Trials**", and it will consist of a series of various milestones for the player to complete.
* Adam Nostrus' Trials are divided in three parts. Completing a part will grant you much needed rewards to complete your build.
+ Completing Part I will grant you the **7th Ancestral Stone**.
+ Completing Part II will grant you the **Primal Ancestral Stone**.
+ Completing Part III will grant you the last Slorm Reaper in the game.

**The Primal Ancestral Stone?!**   
It is a very special Ancestral Stone we've talked about a few times that you will be able to enshrine in any Ancestral Slot without restriction.

This Update, rightfully called The Ancestral Update, will grant the player the final pieces to use the Ancestral Legacy, open up its possibilities and unlock the last Ancestral Skills.  
  
More on that in the next Slormite Chronicles!  
  
  
That's about it!  
Cheers everyone!
