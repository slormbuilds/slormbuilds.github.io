Hello everyone!   
  
Another month! Another Slormite Chronicle!  
  
The Great Forge: Release Date
=============================

  
First and foremost,  
In the last Slormite Chronicles, we've announced that our goal was to release The Great Forge Update before today. Unfortunately, we were not able to make it in time.  
  
We're sorry about the delay, and we feel pretty bad about how much time this update took us. But I also think we're close to something really nice and fun so I don't want to mess up the release because we failed a couple of features or left gamebreaking bugs. I really hope it's for the best and that the amount of work we've put in will pay off.  
  
However, we are now confident enough in what we have to give a proper release date: The Great Forge update will be released on **September 27**.  
I believe we could be ready a week earlier, but The Slormancer will be participating in an online festival that could/should bring a good amount of new players. So that wouldn't be a good time for us to update a new potentially unstable build. So we decided to postpone.   
  
That being said, this time it's for real.  
  
  
The Great Forge: Final Content
==============================

  
This last few weeks, we've been working on polishing The Great Forge and making the final additions to the mode. If you don't know anything about it or want a refresher, I suggest you read [Slormite Chronicles #15](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/3325361215008126727) and [Slormite Chronicles #16](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1104280/announcements/detail/3362518992740887891).  
  
Here are the latest (and final) additions:  
  
Challenges Rewards: War Chest Effects
-------------------------------------

  
Small reminder: the War Chest is where your Rewards from The Great Forge are stored. Every few waves, you can either decide to loot it and move out, or to keep filling it and risk losing everything if you die. You can get all sorts of Rewards inside your War Chest, such as Goldus or Equipment but also War Chest Quality or Quantity multiplier.

![](/assets/patch_notes/79a29dbe8706a6fd35015bc3f44b8ec8fdc20fd9)  
  
In the last Slormite Chronicles, I briefly mentioned that we were thinking about effects to apply to your War Chest. The example given last month was: "Increases War Chest Quantity by 2% for every item type inside your War Chest".  
Well, we really liked the idea so we created **32** of what we call **War Chest Effects**.  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/456703eb2f8f9de1eb2a1fffdacad16dcf78fb31)  
  
These Rewards are usually associated with greater Challenges and are quite rare. But we want them to be gamechanging. If you find a War Chest Effect and manage to build your Rewards around it, then we want it to be extremely rewarding.   
There is a good amount of luck in getting all the right stuff at the right moment, so we are ok with giving lots of rewards when you get everything. This is not meant to be linear farming.  
  
Here are a few examples:   
* For the rest of the Run, your War Chest Quantity is equal to your War Chest Quality.
* When looting your War Chest, if you should loot exactly **1** Equipment, it is guaranteed to be of Legendary rarity.
* The amount of Goldus inside your War Chest becomes equal to **500%** of the Slorm inside your War Chest.
* For the rest of the Run, if there is at least one of each Reapersmith Spirit inside your War Chest, following Rewards are increased by **100%**.

  
The idea is also to give a lot of value to some lesser Rewards such as Slorm and a non mathematically-resolved Great Forge. What if the most efficient way to farm Goldus inside the Great Forge was now to get Slorm Rewards and a proper War Chest Effect?  
  
The Siege Leader
----------------

  
This is the boss of the environment.   
The Siege Leader has unique Challenges applied to him that can either increase his Life or Damage, the variety of its patterns etcâ€¦ Everytime you pick a specific Siege Leader Challenge, you increase his spawn chance by a small amount.   
  
He has a small chance to spawn every few Waves that slowly increases every wave up to 100% at Wave 100. Obviously, if you don't want to wait until Wave 100 to defeat him, then getting Siege Leader Challenges is the way to go. This will result in a faster spawn, but a stronger boss. It's up to you.

Obelisks
--------

  
Obelisks are the final addition of The Great Forge. They are a unique type of enemy that are only spawned through Challenges.  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/658eda6737af2fe7169c28d8163f9d2336666575)  
  
  
Basically, Obelisks Challenges create an Obelisk inside The Great Forge, with a massive Life pool and good resistances. Once they are there, they apply a negative effect (eg: *While Obelisk of Revocation is active, you cannot restore Life.*) that will stop only once they are destroyed.   
This means you have to take care of your current Wave AND get rid of the Obelisk as soon as possible.  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/79bf94c087495f81a051cd43334621cf20daf4ac)  
  
But there's a twist. Obelisks always come with a specific Obelisk Reward. Basically, once you've dealt with the Obelisk, it will turn into an Allied Obelisk, transforming its negative effect into a positive one (eg: *Allied Obelisk of Revocation adds **+12%** War Chest Quantity to your War Chest everytime you complete a Wave*) but now you have to keep them alive and defend them from the Waves to keep their effect active.  
  
  
The Great Forge: Entry Price
----------------------------

  
Given the generosity of The Great Forge regarding rewards and enemy density, we've decided to add a small Elder Slorm fee to get in. This should not be an issue but still something to take into account. I can't give the definitive price since I believe it is going to be changed before the release. Also, since War Chest Rewards are based on your Wrath Level, the Elder Slorm fee will also be Wrath-dependant.  
This is basically just a heads up so that you can upgrade your Elder Slorm jauge and fill it before the release. :)  
  
  
That's about it for today.  
  
We'll upload a Patch Notes with every change and addition we've made to the game a couple of days before the release.  
  
Have a nice day everyone!
