Hello!  
Don’t mind me, I’m just fixing a few minor bugs.  
  

* This issue with the various Passives and Upgrades stacking up everytime you come back to the Village or Load your Save has been resolved.
* The following Achievements should now work properly:
* Ancient Slorm Siphoner
* Legendary Object Collection
* Legion, Reaper of Unity should now target properly and display the correct sprites.

  
  
Cheers!
