Patch Notes
-----------

  
  
**The Beginning of the End:**  
The Slormancer can now be completed! An epic final boss fight is available once you reach the end of the Trials.  
  
**The Netherworld:**  
A new endgame mode called The Netherworld has been added to The Slormancer. It features a detailed map of the Netherworld to explore, 45 Cataclysm Runs to complete, and 25 Warlords to defeat. Once all Warlords have been defeated, a Primordial version of the Warlords becomes accessible.  
  
Each Cataclysm Run features an increased minimum Pure Stat Score and Pure Stat Chance for one stat, chosen at random. Each Warlord Expedition is also assigned a random group of Legendary Equipment, which changes at the end of each Expedition, allowing players to target specific Legendary effects.  
  
Additionally, each Cataclysm Expedition grants Nether Charge, increasing the chance of finding Nether rarity Equipment from Warlords. Upon defeating a Warlord, you’ll be able to choose from 3 Legendary/Nether Items, with the option to reroll each slot once.  
  
**Level cap:**  
The Level Cap has reached its final form and is now set to 100.
