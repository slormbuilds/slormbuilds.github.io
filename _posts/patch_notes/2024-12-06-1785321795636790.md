Welcome to The Slormite Chronicles #44!  
  
If you've missed the last Slormite Chronicles, here's a brief recap of where we're at: We're almost done with the development part of The Slormancer. Last month, we had the missing 120 Legendary Effects to deal with, along with the final boss fight. As of last week, we're done with Legendary Effects and we are about a week away from being done with the final fight.  
  
So we're making solid progress.  
  
Once we're done with this, we'll have a bunch of testing and debugging to do until everything feels good enough to go into 1.0. At the same time, we're working on verifying texts and get going on the various translations we want for The Slormancer, along with reworking the Chinese translation whose flaws are no longer in doubt.  
  
**"Ok kewl, release date wen ?"**  
  
Releasing The Slormancer and making sure that it catches as much attention as we think it deserves will be a real challenge, and it will require time and preparation. This is something that we cannot afford to rush.  
  
On top of that, we're working with various partners to release the game on different platforms and in as many languages as we can, so we have to get a green light from everyone.  
  
If everything goes our way, and given what needs to be done, we should be able to release the game around late-Q1 2025.   
  
New Legendary Items
-------------------

  
Back to what we've been working on: Legendary Effects!  
We've added 120 Effects to get to a total of 200.  
  
We now have about 20 Legendary Effects for each slot so it should introduce more options to some of the weakest slots. And as you may have read in a previous Slormite Chronicles, the new Nether rarity will allow you to Graft Effects from a slot to another, so you can get that sweet Indomitable Mountain effect on Boots if you want to.  
  
There is now at least one Legendary Effect for each Class Skill, Support Skill and Class Mechanic, so that's about 15 Legendary Items that are specific to a class. Then about 27 Legendary Effects for the Ancestral Legacy tree. And finally, we've added 12 Legendary Effects for Slorm Reapers.  
  
Without further ado, here are some teasers!
