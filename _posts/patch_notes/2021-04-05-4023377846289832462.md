Hello everyone!  
  
We wanted to make one last post before release, hopefully answering the last questions you might have before launch.  
  

Price and Bundles
=================

  
First, the price.  
The Slormancer will be available at **$14.99** during Early Access.  
There will be a **15%** Discount at Launch, for a week.  
So about **$12.75** at Launch.  
  
The Soundtrack of The Slormancer will also be available at launch, at **$5.99** alone.  
About 2-hour long of Epic & Spooky Music. No less!  
  
**These prices may vary depending on the country you live in.**  
  
A bundle with The Slormancer+Soundtrack will be available as well, with a **10%** Discount.  
You can already check/wishlish the [Steam page of the Soundtrack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1110800/The_Slormancer__Original_Soundtrack/)!  
  
We're super proud of the Soundtrack, and we really hope you'll like it.  
If you want to listen to the Main Theme right away, it's [right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YK8v8iv_LQ&ab_channel=OrelusOne)!  
  
  

Release Time ?
==============

  
The Slormancer will be available at **7PM CET**.  
To make it easy for all timezones, here's a beautiful [countdown to release](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/gaming?iso=20210406T19&p0=37&msg=Slormancer+Release&font=cursive).  
  
  

Content Available at Early Access Launch
========================================

  
This one is really important as it raised some concern among the community so we wanted to address this before release: **The Trailer and a couple of screenshots on the Steam page feature some content that will only become available in later Early Access updates.**  
  
The most important thing being the Ancestral Skill Tree and Elemental-related skills that you can find on it: As we mentioned in our Early Access Q&A (that you can read on our [Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1104280/The_Slormancer/)), only the first 2 Tiers of the Ancestral Tree (out of 7) will be available at launch.  
  
Not because they are not ready, but because they are unlocked throughout the story, and since the first version of Early Access is limited to the first act of the story, you will not be able to unlock the 5 missing tiers until we add new acts.  
  
Same goes for environments, you will have access to 2 different environments, out of 7, and they will also be available through later acts.  
  
  

End Game Content
================

  
Another common question was the Endgame content available at launch.  
Basically, once you have completed the first part of the story (which should take about 4 hours), you will have access to a mode called "Battlefield".  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/3f53e44359f0723a2edb6ecfcad0c228f184a326)  
  
In "Battlefield", you will be teleported to a randomly generated area where your goal will be to slay every enemy around, while looting equipment and materials for crafting, gaining experience and unlocking new NPCs.  
  
There are a good number of features to unlock once you're done with the story, including various forms of crafting, new materials and NPCs but also Slorm Reapers and Legendary items.  
  
You will also be able to increase the difficulty by using Wrath: A modifier that will increase the strength of enemies you face but also the rewards and experience you get.  
  
It's the barebones of the endgame we want for The Slormancer, but we feel like there's plenty to do with it.  
  
  

Early Access
============

  
The game is an Early Access, and we are trying to be as transparent as possible regarding what's in the game right now, so we strongly encourage you to read our Early Access Q&A. For your convenience, it has been pasted just below.  
  
We also posted a [Road Map](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1104280/view/3028081693984863647), so you can find out what's coming next and what we're working on.  
  
**Why Early Access?**  
*“We want to make The Slormancer the best game it can be, and we know that working with our community and listening to players' suggestions during Early Access will be key to achieve this.”  
Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?  
“Since The Slormancer is our very first game and since there are only two of us, it is difficult to accurately estimate how long Early Access will last.  
  
The Slormancer will be released as a final version when we feel the game is complete and polished, which may take some time. We have a lot of content that we still want to add and new features. Not to mention what needs to be tweaked or modified during Early Access.  
  
But expect approximately two years.”*  
  
**How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?**  
*“The final version of The Slormancer will feature a complete adventure and rich end-game content. We plan to extend the bestiary with new enemy types and new bosses. New Legendary items, skills, and Achievements will also be introduced.”*  
  
**What is the current state of the Early Access version?**  
*“Players can already play 3 complete classes up to level 40 (out of 100), as well as access the first two tiers (out of 7) of the general skill tree of the game and allocate skill points for their class. More than 30 (out of 120) Slorm Reapers, which are unique weapons, are available to each class, as well as their primordial version.  
  
Players can also find all types of equipment in the game, with dozens of different stats, as well as materials for the upgrade and crafting systems, which are also already present. 80 Legendary items, with unique effects, are also available (and we plan to add many, many more of those).  
  
Most of the game's features are also integrated: dialogues, cinematics, non-player characters, combat, tutorials, the possibility to play with the mouse, the keyboard or the controller, everything is there.  
  
Nevertheless, players will only have access to one act of the story (out of 5) for now, which represents an experience of a few hours. Endgame content is present but also limited, as is the diversity of environments and the variety of enemies.  
These are very important points for us and will be our priority during the first phases of Early Access.  
  
However, the gameplay loop is complete: Players can now embark on an adventure, defeat monsters, find loot, level up, improve their skills, and start again, increasing the difficulty if they wish to.  
  
Despite our best efforts, the game probably still has some bugs. Also, skills, items and enemies most likely lack proper balancing.”*  
  
**Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?**  
*“We expect to increase the price of the game by an undetermined amount when it comes out of Early Access.”*  
  
**How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?**  
*“Since our first demo, we've made it a point to listen to all the relevant feedback from our players, which has already helped The Slormancer move in the right direction.  
Players will be able to provide feedback on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tkYxSuB), our [Reddit,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Slormancer/) or our [Steam Community Page](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1104280/discussions/) where we will strive to be both accessible and receptive.”*  
  

Questions?
==========

  
If you have any other questions or concerns, please, feel free to ask!  
  
We hope to see you on April 6 for release!  
Cheers!
