Hello everyone!  
  
Don't mind me, I'm just fixing a few things I broke in yesterday's update.  
  

Bugs:
-----

  

* Super Elite Enemies should no longer appear without a proper name (Colossus and Necromancer)
* Unstable Imps AoE's should now properly follow them when being pulled.
* The Alternate Recipe of Slormelines should no longer mess with the Craft of Slormandrites.
* The List of Epic Rolls should no longer be offsetted while reforging an Epic Item.
* Primordial Aiondee should now properly work again.
* Bryan's "In The Circle" protection should now properly disappear.

  
  

Performance:
------------

  
Fixed a memory leak causing the FPS to slow down in The Great Forge (eventually leading to crashes).  
  
That's about it!
