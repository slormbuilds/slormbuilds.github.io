Hello everyone!   
  
First, we want to thank you for your feedback and positive reactions for the release of The Prison Update. We feel like we went back on tracks and we are much more confortable with the current state of the game than we were before.  
  

The Mage Academy Update
=======================

  
Let's talk about the future of The Slormancer.  
The Mage Academy Update (Major Update n°2) will be divided in 3 smaller Updates. Each one bringing its share of new content, reworks and bug fixes.  
  
Keep in mind that this is a very raw short-term Road Map and that things may change over time.  
  
**The Mage Academy Update, Part.1**  

* 20 New Slorm Reapers
* Materials Tab in Inventory
* 5 New Enemies
* The Mage Academy environment in Expeditions

  
  
**The Mage Academy Update, Part.2**  

* Act III
* New Level Cap
* New Ancestral Legacy Tier
* Act I Rework
* New Cataclysms & Exaltations

*About the rework of Act I: This is a major issue for us, because a lot of players just stop right there after a couple of hours and never get to see the rest of the game, which is where the content is. So we want to make it less tedious, probably shorter, increase the variety of enemies now that we have some, and introduce a bunch of Exaltations as well as Named Elites. We're not going to start over, just make it better.*  
  
**The Mage Academy Update, Part.3**  

* New Endgame Content

*It was previously called "Trials of Grit" in the Road Map, we internally call it "The Great Forge" now. I can't tell you much about it but it's going to be related to Reapers, and should introduce a great amount of variety to them…*  
  
We currently have no date to communicate. But it's probably safe to say that Part 1 should be available around January. :)  
  
  

Slorm Reapers
=============

  
We are currently working on Part.1 and this is what we're going to talk about next, starting with Slorm Reapers.  
  
Before we begin, please remember that designs and numbers are **not final**. We are currently implementing new Reapers in the game and we have yet to test them. Also, while I code their behavior, the rest of the team (being one other guy) is currently working on updating the look of Reapers, so they are a better match for their effect. This means that the skin of pretty much all Slorm Reapers down below will be different for release.  
  
We are bringing 20 new Slorm Reapers to The Slormancer and I believe we took the time to dig a bit deeper and find more visually appealing and/or original effects. We also tried to give some love to stats and/or builds that deserved it.

**Fate-Crusher, Reaper of the Seven** is a new concept that takes advantage of all Reaper bonuses available on your equipment. Reaper bonuses also directly affect the effects of this Slorm Reaper.  
  
**Reaper of Retaliating Foresight** was built with the idea of removing the "passive defense" behavior of Retaliation and be active with it.  
  
**Reaper of Inner Strength** is a simple yet quite fun Reaper, that will hopefully enable Inner Fire builds.

**Sovereign Reaper of Great Necromancy** is our way to introduce some sort of Summoning skills to the game while people wait for a possible official Necromancer class. :)  
  
**New ways to unlock Slorm Reapers**  
We are trying to diversify the way you get Slorm Reapers. As of right now, there's only one Slorm Reaper (Aurifurious, Reaper born of Fusion) that can't be found through loot. And we really like the idea and would like to push into that direction.   
With this Update, 3 out of the 20 Slorm Reapers will only be unlocked by other ways than loot.  
  
Behold! The Elder Staff of The Slorm Temple. This one will be purchasable from Olorin, at an outrageous (yet reasonable) Pure Slorm price.

**Primordial Slorm Reapers**  
Since we're talking about Slorm Reapers, I'd like to address the Primordial Slorm Reaper issue:  
  
We've yet to come up with a solution but we are well aware that the current amount of farm required to unlock one (or even multiple) Primordial Slorm Reapers is a problem, plus the fact that you have to grind it back up to a decent level once you've unlocked it. Nothing is set in stone but we have various ideas. And we will hopefully be able to implement a solution for this Update.  
  

The Mage Academy
================

  
This part is ready and implemented. I'm reusing screenshots from very old devlogs, but here's what it looks like.

Materials Tab in Inventory
==========================

  
Aren't you tired of having sort your inventory? Don't you get angry when you have to give a Greater Slormite to another one of your characters? And that room space lost with that absurd amount of crafting materials?   
  
Say no more! We're introducing the Materials Tab to The Slormancer, where everything is easy and properly sorted. Infinite stacking! Shared among your characters! A haven of peace. YOUR haven of peace.  
  
![](/assets/patch_notes/8588fa42538b11acff5675d17405eaead50de4d9)  
  
That's it for now. We have nothing to share about new enemies since we've yet to work on them.  
Merry Christmas everyone!
