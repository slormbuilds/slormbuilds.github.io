Hello everyone!  
We're back with another Slormite Chronicles to keep you updated with the development of The Slormancer. And since we've published a rather large update last week, we have nothing super exciting to share right now besides our plans for the near future.  
  
Here's what we have in store for the upcoming weeks:  
  

Bug Fix Patch
-------------

  
This monday, we will upload a patch that should fix the last remaining issues and bugs that were found in The Slorm Temple update.   
  
I've also added a proper way of handling Cloud and Local saves. From now on, if there is a conflict between your saves, you will get a message upon starting the game asking you to choose the save you want to keep. So you should no longer lose progress when playing offline.  
  
It requires a bit of testing on our side so I'm delaying this patch until monday morning so I can fix bugs quickly if things go wrong.   
  

Treasure Chests
---------------

  
Shortly after, we will introduce Treasure Chests into the game.  
This is a bonus feature that was supposed to be in The Slorm Temple update but we did not had the chance to finish it before the deadline. So we plan to add this as a small content update later this month once we're done.  
  
This is a super simple feature: you will be able to find chests containing various kinds of loot during Battlefield Expeditions and inside The Slorm Temple. Nothing crazy, just something cool and new to look for during your runs.

Story Act II
------------

  
Once we're done with these couple of patches, we will move onto Act II. This includes new missions, dialogues, bosses and a new Ancestral Stone to get to tier 3 in your Ancestral Legacy.  
  
We will give more infos about Act II, the number of missions and bosses a bit later, probably in our next Chronicle since things are not set in stone on our end right now.  
  

Act I Rework
------------

  
We also have plans to rework Act I, and try to add new enemies, various exciting events and objectives as well since we are well aware that it feels pretty repetitive for a good amount of players right now and even discourages some to try the rest of the content.  
  
If you happen to have complaints about Act I and/or specific missions that felt tedious or boring, or if you have specific things in mind you would like to see improved or even cool concepts and ideas of missions that would fit in The Slormancer. Please, feel free to share in the comments.  
  
  
That's about it for now!  
Have a nice day everyone!
