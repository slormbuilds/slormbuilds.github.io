Hello everyone!  
  
The Steam Awards are live!   
  
The Slormancer is at the beginning of its Early Access journey and although the reception has been really positive, we are far from the game we want it to be. We still have a lot of features to implement, things to uprove and that many bugs to squash.  
  
For this reason, it doesn't feel appriopriate for us to compete for "Gameplay" or "Gamedesign" awards just yet.  
  
That being said, there is one thing that is complete in The Slormancer: its Soundtrack.   
We were very happy with it from the start but the amount of outstanding love it got from the community was not expected. If you too think that we've made an excellent job with the soundtrack, then we would be humbled if you could vote for The Slormancer for Best Soundtrack during the Steam Awards.  
  
  
With a little bit of Slorm, nothing's impossible.  
Let's get it togeter!  
  
Thank you!
