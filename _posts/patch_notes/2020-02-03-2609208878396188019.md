Hello Everyone!  
We're finally done with environments (at least for the Early Access release). The last area: "The Wizards Academy" is ready.  
  
We're pretty happy with how this one turned out! Check it out:  
  
**The Wizards Academy**

**Environments are ready**  
So we have a total of 5 playable, unique and procedurally generated environments. The Wizards Academy, The Prison, The Graveyard, The Gardens and The Royal Wing.

**What's next?**  
Now, the next step is to finalize player's progression throughout the story and these environments and create a nice transition to The Slormancer's late game.  
  
We're super excited!  
That's it for now!
