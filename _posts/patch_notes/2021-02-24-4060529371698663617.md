Hello everyone!  
  
We've had a lot of controversy about the default control scheme of the game (WASD/Mouse by default, like Enter the Gungeon, or Hades) and had a lot of feedback on most of our social platforms from people that wanted an experience closer to what they were used to in the Action-RPG genre.  
  
So we've decided to add a "Click to Move" option to The Slormancer with all that's expected.  
  
You can now pretty much play The Slormancer any way you want (Controller, Click to Move or WASD), you can rebind everything aswell so you can customize the controls to your needs.  
  
Also, we had a small timeframe in our schedule before our Early Access release so it will not impact or delay the release of the game more than it already was.  
  
We'll announce the final date soon, once everything is ready on our side.  
  
Thanks for reading!  
  
See you soon in The Slormancer!   
With a Mouse, an Xbox controller, or a Wheel if you feel like it.
