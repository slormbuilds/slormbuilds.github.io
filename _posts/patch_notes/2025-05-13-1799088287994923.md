The Slormancer is now out of Early Access
-----------------------------------------

  
The Slormancer is the result of countless hours of work but it was made possible thanks to the incredible support, feedback, and passion of our player community throughout its development. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for being part of this adventure!

Migrating a Save File from Experimental to Live
-----------------------------------------------

  
If you've been playing the Experimental Branch and would like to carry your progress over to the Live Branch, there is a small extra step that needs to be done:  

[\*]Head over to C:/Users/<Username>/AppData/Local/The\_Slormancer and find the save\_exp\_cbeta\_1 file, copy it and rename it to save\_1 (and copy or erase the previous file).  
[\*]When you launch The Slormancer, if Steam asks you to choose between the Local and the Cloud file, choose Local.  
[\*]Profit!  

*This assumes that you are playing on the Save Slot 1.   
if not, simply change the numbers accordingly (e.g: Rename save\_exp\_cbeta\_2 -> save\_2 etc…)*  
  
Have fun!  
Cheers!
