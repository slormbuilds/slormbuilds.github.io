Hello everyone!  
  

The Slormancer leaves Early Access tomorrow
-------------------------------------------

  
-sweating intensifies-  
  
[Here's a count down timer to the release](https://countingdownto.com/?c=6242688).  
  

Supporter Pack
--------------

  
Our wonderful Supporter Pack is now available!  
  
However, please note that its content will only be accessible with the 1.0 version of the game, which will be released **tomorrow** *unless* you’re participating in the Experimental Branch, in which case you’ll have immediate access to its content.

**Slorm of Gold**  
In The Slormancer, Bryan didn’t have the best fate… but that doesn’t mean he can’t shine! With this DLC, give him a second (and much more radiant) chance with the "Slorm of Gold" alternative skin.  
  
Say goodbye to the spectral blue: Bryan now reincarnates as a glowing yellow orb and gains ethereal wings. More celestial than ever, he now floats with divine grace (or almost).  
  
But that’s not all! When Bryan transforms into a door, he is no longer just any door… he becomes a golden door. With Wings!  
  
A simple cosmetic change? Maybe. A glorious new aura for Bryan? Absolutely!  
  
This Supporter Pack includes:  
  
A Golden Skin for Bryan, the little ghostly orb following the player.  
  
A Golden Skin for the teleportation doors created by Bryan and used throughout the game.  
  
**Supporting the Team**  
By purchasing this Supporter Pack, you’re not just giving Bryan a fresh new look—you’re also supporting two independent developers who put all their passion into The Slormancer.  
  
Creating and evolving a game is a challenging adventure, and every bit of support helps us continue improving the experience, adding more content, and pouring even more love into the game’s universe.  
  
If you love The Slormancer, if you love Bryan, or if you just think there aren’t enough wings in the base game, then this pack is for you!
