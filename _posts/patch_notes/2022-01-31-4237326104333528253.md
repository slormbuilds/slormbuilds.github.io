Hello everyone!  
  
The Mage Academy Update, Part 1 is now available!  
You can read the full Patch Notes in our previous announcement post [here](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1104280/view/4330775883759407894).  
  
Tl;DR:  
- 19 new Slorm Reapers  
- 5 new Enemies  
- A new Environment: The Mage Academy  
- A new tab for your Inventory  
- Lots of bug fixing  
  
  
We try our best to limit the numbers of bugs when releasing new content but we always get reports of new bugs in the first few days of a patch.  
  
If you found a bug, then please report it here, on our [Steam forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1104280/discussions/), or on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tkYxSuB). We try to fix crashes and critical bugs within a day, so please be patient.  
  
Thanks!
