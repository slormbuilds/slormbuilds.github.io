After the campaign, you might have to start swapping to other skills and upgrades for better clear and damage. This will very likely result in mana sustain issues as the additional mana cost of some upgrades and elemental imbues are pretty extreme.

You will have to get a mana leech mod on your gear, it is pointless getting more than 1 mana leech mod. Sources of mana leech:

* Soul of the Wizard (Ancestral Legacy)  
* Magic/Rare mods on Bracers  
* Epic mods on Amulet, Gloves and Bracers

 If you still do not have enough mana sustain, get the mana on hit mod on your gear, you can stack as many as you need. Do not bother with % mana on hit as they are worse than simply getting more flat mana on hit. Sources of mana on hit:

* Zeal (Attributes)  
* Regenerative Strikes (Ancestral Legacy)  
* Heart of the Wizard (Ancestral Legacy)  
* Moonlight Essence Ring (Legendary Effect on Rings)  
* Magic/Rare mods on Helmet, Chest Armour and Bracers  
* Epic mods on Helmet, Chest Armour, Cape, Belt, Gloves, Bracers and Shoulders

Other mana sustain solutions:

* Zeal 15  
* Faith of the Ancients (Legendary Effect on Helmets)  
* Tear of Arah (Legendary Effect on Amulets)  
* Primordial Ungifted Reaper  
* Ultimatum of Adamant Abundance  
* Crimson Pact (Legendary Effect on Rings)
