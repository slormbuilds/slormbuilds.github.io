Welcome to my build guide for the Polyvalent Caster Mage, designed around managing to marry the insane Arcane Bond scaling of Arcane Breach with the power of Chrono-Puncture’s “Time Manipulation” node by using the Devoted Scholar tree and it’s inconspicuous Polyvalent Caster node. It’s a build I’m very proud of because it took a lot of work to theorycraft. This is far from the most busted thing in this game, but if that’s stopping you from trying it, consider this: Maybe it won’t be nerfed ;)

 Pros:

* - Easy to scale damage (Does fairly good damage even with random +0 gear due to the multiplicative mechanics of Time Manip and Reap What You Sow)
* - Easy to play (Drop breaches and kill enemies behind you as you run from rift to rift)
* - No necessary Legendaries (But the Primordial Slormreaper is a notable DPS spike)
* - Good Starter build for Wraths 8 to 10
* - Creative, very unique
* - High synergy
* - Powerful but “fair”, unlikely to get nerfed (Unique implementation of Polyvalent Caster, but doesn’t break the game in a way that feels like it needs a nerf. Great Starter build.)

  
Cons:

* - Difficult to scale defense (Life Leech is less effective due to what damage type we scale, Mage does not have many defensive options, melee range)
* - Slow (No mobility skill, spin-up time to kill packs on higher Wraths)
* - Complex (Atypical, doesn’t want usual stats like crit)
* - Chrono-Puncture is painful to level. (Need Tier IV to become functional)
* - Not insanely busted/no exploits

With almost 0 investment (+4~+5 gear with relevant but unoptimized stat lines) and 0 legendaries I can clear Wrath 10 fairly quickly if I play well- but I can farm Wrath 8 or 9 extremely comfortably, running from rift to rift with dirt-cheap gear and exploding packs. I think this is a highly unique and easy to scale starter build for any Mage player, and strongly recommend to give it a try.

Skills

Chrono-Puncture

The first skill is Chrono-Puncture for the obvious synergy between the Time Manipulation node that spends and refunds all of your mana every time you hit an enemy with Chrono-Puncture, and the Arcane Bond debuff that deals Elemental Damage equal to how much mana you spent in the last second. The synergy here is probably evident to any player on their first go of Mage, but it’s the other synergies I was able to exploit that I’m much more proud of.

Arcane Breach

The very next thing any player attempting to build an Arcane Bond build after discovering Time Manipulation will do is try and find the best skill to combine it with. You need a reliable way to apply Arcane Bond to as many targets as possible for clear speed, along with hopefully more ways to stack mana and Arcane Bond damage. I am probably not the first person to lock on to Arcane Breach’s “Permanent Bond” node that refreshes Arcane Bond duration, only to be miserably disappointed that the devs wording in this game is very intentional and indeed, refreshing is not the same as applying. Thus it would seem that the hope for getting to abuse Arcane Breach’s powerful Arcane Bond nodes (Double Slip Knot and ESPECIALLY Reap What You Sow) dies here. But after a lot of pouring over other options like Attunement Pulse and Arcane Missile and finding them unsatisfactory, I resolved to find a way to make Arcane Breach work.

Wall of Omen (Devoted Scholar)

Here is the big breakthrough that makes this build work. As I stated earlier the first problem any Arcane Bond build has to overcome is finding a way to apply the debuff, and despite the fact that it’s not really all that powerful, the game is insanely cheap about giving you the option to apply it. Probably the best Arcane Bond build besides this one is something using Arcane Missiles “Transcending Obliteration” and the Obliteration type conversion for Chrono-Puncture, but this results in a lot of awkward mixed scaling as you need a lot of Pierce to make that work and likely scales worse because of the greater synergy with Arcane Breach. (More testing is needed though)  
  
But if we want to use Arcane Breach and it’s busted Arcane Bond nodes, while still being able to only equip two skills-- how do we apply Arcane Bond?! The answer is actually within the Devoted Scholar passive tree. The node “Polyvalent Caster” is an extremely unique one and as is the case in any ARPG, thus has the most potential to break things. “If your last 2 Emblems are different, the next skill you cast will apply Arcane Bond to every enemy hit.” Polyvalent Caster is the only way in the game to break what the devs intended and get ANY skill to apply Arcane Bond, including Arcane Breach. Success! Finally a reliable way to both use Arcane Breach + Chrono-Puncture, while also giving insanely mass AoE application to boot. Incredible synergy!  


Skill Trees

Now let’s take a look at each node and why they were selected. The most satisfying thing about this build is how you can see how few nodes don’t provide something this build wants, despite how quirky it is compared to the traditional way the game is played.

Chrono-Puncture

![](/assets/posts/PolyvalentCasterMage/images/image8.png)

I - Chrono-Manipulation: Chrono-Manipulation was a lot better when it was bugged and just instantly regened all your mana, but it’s still good. The important thing not to forget with Arcane Bond and Time Manip is that even though we stack a lot of Max Mana for our DPS output, it’s not exactly what we scale off. Our damage isn’t based on our Max Mana but rather how much mana we spend (i.e. how much mana we have at the time Time Manip procs). This means that actually having mana regen is just as important for our build as max mana, which makes this build unfortunately more persnickety than it already is. Thankfully Chrono-Manipulation along with many other nodes amongst the 3 trees we chose provide ample Mana Regen, and a little bit of Mana Leech on gear will make up the rest. If you find you don’t need the Mana Regen for some reason and can always Chrono-Puncture at your maximum mana anyways, Critical Time + Chrono-Lock at Tier V of the tree is very good for single-target as well.  
II - Chrono-Speed: This node compares very similarly to Chrono-Manamorphosis, and your choice will depend on how solid your mana regen is as well as how much attack speed vs. max mana you are getting from other sources. Attack speed falls off beyond a certain point especially on skills that already have a low CD like Chrono-Puncture, but this is a very efficient source of it when combined with the Tier V upgrade and frees up lines on your gear for more Max Mana%.  
III - Fury of the Chronomancer: Weakest node on this tree, and yet still not entirely a waste. Single target is undoubtedly the biggest weakness of this build, considering we scale based on how many enemies we have a Breach under, but the multiplicative damage of this node helps to alleviate that somewhat. Nothing else is really worth taking. If you get the Legendary that gives you a 10% to turn your regular Chrono-Puncture casts into the Remnant version, your single-target will be completely fixed.  
IV - Time Manipulation: What more can be said. Jump into the Timeless Prison and instantly spend as well as restore all of your mana. This is what makes the build work, letting you dump 100k+ mana in a single cast. 

V - Superior Chrono-Upgrade: 10 more stacks for your Tier II node of choice. Obviously more beneficial on Chrono-Speed than Chrono-Manamorphosis, but regardless it’s still impactful. Other options are very tempting though, mainly for increasing single target damage. Chrono-Remnants gives you a 10% chance to deal your 10000% damage Puncture instead, which combined with Fury of the Chronomancer can really put the hurt on Elites. In my testing though it never seemed as major as it should. Chrono-Lock along with Critical Time at Tier I, assuming you’ve got your mana regen sorted, can help to further scale your Elite single-target damage as things start to multiply out of control, but it still feels somewhat slow and underwhelming.

Arcane Breach

![](/assets/posts/PolyvalentCasterMage/images/image3.png)

I - Reap What You Sow: The skill and node we bend over backwards to enable, this is where all of the build’s scaling comes from. It’s multiplicative nature is an obvious target for busted hijinks, and so we use it to its maximum potential here. The mana regen is welcome, but we’re mostly interested in stacking as much max mana as we can by putting (multiple) breaches under packs of enemies, applying Arcane Bond and turning their own numbers against them to melt them. Basically the more enemies you get Breaches under, the more damage you’ll deal. This will get you up to 100k+ mana pools and help you to pop packs at Wrath 10.

II - Multi-Breaches: At first I really wanted to take Peaceful Breach for even more CDR, but I learned that too much CDR is actually a bad thing in this build, at least when it comes to comfy spam-your-buttons-gameplay. (This has to do with Polyvalent Caster’s condition on applying Arcane Bond) Anyways, having your Breach deal damage enables stuff like Leech, so it’s a good thing at the end of the day. If you get enough CDR from other sources, you can take Multi-Breaches off entirely (easing your mana requirements) or experiment with swapping to Permanent Bond (doesn’t do much) or even Eternal Breach, which actually is quite good if you’re okay with the slower clear times for more damage.

III - Double Slip Knot: Ayyy, more Arcane Bond scaling. Just a great node for this type of build and another reason why Arcane Breach is worth working for. Other options are irrelevant.

IV - Ephemeral Rift: Optional node. The massive increase to AoE is a huge boost to clear speed, but the 3 second duration can be quite a burden to bear as it reduces the maximum number of Breaches you can stack at a time, reducing your mana pool and thus DPS. The alternative then is using Tier II’s Eternal Breach, which gives the same amount of AoE (Don’t stack them, they become too big @\_@) but without the duration penalty. On the other hand, waiting 2 seconds for your breaches to open is also quite a drag on your clear speed, not to mention your survivability as you will start leeching slower. All in all Ephemeral Rift is an extremely good node, but if you want to deal maximum damage-over-time at the cost of clear speed, Eternal Breach is also an option. All other nodes have 0 effect.

V - Gravitational Force: Great node. Permanently pulls enemies away from you, making you basically immune to melee damage. (Although you still have to get pretty close to cast Chrono-Puncture) Groups up enemies so you can dedicate all your Breach spam to one massive pile of them and stack mana past the hundred thousands. Another reason I am so happy I found a way to make Arcane Breach apply Arcane Bond.

Wall of Omen (Devoted Scholar)

![](/assets/posts/PolyvalentCasterMage/images/image10.png)

I - Endless Stocks: The first of many good nodes from this tree, which makes me question why Arcane Bond is listed as the Arcane Commander’s specialty instead, considering it has almost 0 applicable nodes aside from it’s capstone. (which admittedly is quite good, but in reality is “only” a 25% damage increase) More free mana, what more can be said? The increased area of effect is also quite good but this is a sizable chunk of mana so we’ll take it instead.

II - Proximity Alert: Two nodes in, already two nodes built for Arcane Bond! Nice! The movespeed Wall of Omen would be really nice, but 65% damage is hard to beat.  
III - Magic Mutation: It said it scaled off max mana so I took it. Obviously completely useless here as Mage can’t scale thorns at all, so not sure what the devs were thinking, but at least it has some sort of effect for this build unlike the other two. If you’re using Critical Time from Tier I of Chrono-Puncture, feel free to take the Time Stop nodes anywhere it seems appropriate.

IV - Immaterial Body: Area Damage Reduction is a nice stat to have, even if I wish it was Projectile Damage Reduction instead. Slow Awakening is a trap since if we have low mana, we’re doing almost 0 damage because of Time Manip anyways.

V - Polyvalent Caster: Yay, the namesake node. Let’s review how it works, since the wording is a bit confusing: “If your last 2 Emblems are different, the next skill you cast will apply Arcane Bond to every enemy hit.” After a bug fix, this now means that your two most recent skills need to be of a different type, but the current skill you’re casting can be of any type. Thus in order to proc this on every hit, you need to constantly alternate between Chrono-Puncture and Arcane Breach, which will require a lot of CDR on Arcane Breach. Thankfully, the Rank VIII upgrade is an incredibly powerful fix for that!   
 VI - Wall of Termination: Nothing else really does anything, but this is a super nice QoL node anyways as destroying enemy projectiles means you can drop the Wall of Omen and Gravitational Force-empowered Breaches and forget about anything in front of you for 15+ seconds.

VII - Easing Pain: I am very sad about this node. We are quite squishy (and tragically melee range) so any form of mitigation is highly appreciated, but Mage has almost no defensive options even in this supposedly “balanced” specialization, apart from Easing Pain. Unfortunately, almost no damage in the current build of the game deals Elemental Damage, so it’s quite a waste and we remain painfully squishy. At least Wrath 5 Skeleton Mage blasts won’t wipe you off the face of the earth, potentially.  
VIII - Emblematic Caster (Rank1 0): After the bug fix, take this all the to Rank 10. This is an extremely powerful node and let’s us cast Arcane Breach about as fast as we cast Chrono-Puncture, ensuring we’re always applying Arcane Bond on all of our casts. Some free mana-cost reduction on Chrono-Puncture too!

Slormreaper

Phew, we did it. Nearly at the end. Here is the best Slormreaper for this build:![](/assets/posts/PolyvalentCasterMage/images/image2.png)

Very glad I had this drop early and decided to put in the work to level it even when no one knew what its Primordial effect was, because it turned out it’s very powerful. While the Raw Damage is completely wasted here, the free Max Mana stats alone make this valuable pre-Primordial, and the Affliction proc helps out our single target a little bit more. But after becoming Primordial is when your damage really amps up. A ton of extra Elemental Damage added onto the Arcane Bonds proc damage is a massive DPS boost, and also helps to start scaling the Afflict debuff and Chrono-Puncture if you can find the legendary that lets you proc Remnants to improve your single-target DPS. On the other hand, as I stated at the beginning of this guide, our damage is actually not simply based on our max mana however, and is actually how much mana we have at the time of each Time Manip proc, so the Malediction is quite the cross to bear. That said, thanks to the wealth of synergizing mana regen options like Chrono-Manipulation stacking with Endless Stocks and Reap What You Sow, with a touch of Mana Leech, this should be sustainable. In any case Ferocious Affinity really makes you wish you could dual-wield it and Manabender at the same time!

Ancestral Legacy

![](/assets/posts/PolyvalentCasterMage/images/image7.png)

Since we struggle with single-target, I like the Elemental Temper node shown here, for the 40% Ele Damage stim buff. The prior Magic Find node is one I’m really happy to take too so it’s a good path. That said, if you need more mana regen, Heart of the Wizard is also really good.

Important Stats

Let’s review Arcane Bond:

“Arcane Bond deals Elemental Damage every second equal to the 100% of the Mana you’ve spent or lost during that second.”  
  
So clearly, the stats we want to scale are both Max Mana as well as Elemental Damage, along with probably some Elemental Penetration. Of course, we also need Attack Speed to proc Time Manip as much as possible. However a build this unique has a host of other problems to address as well:  


* One shot squishiness (Melee range build that does it’s damage over time is very risky)
* \*Life Leech (More than usual since your DPS that can actually leech is quite low)
* Mana Leech (Max Mana alone isn’t sufficient, your damage comes from current mana.)
* Sufficient AoE (The more enemies you affect with each Arcane Breach, the more mana and thus more DPS you get)
* Single target scaling

Here are the stats to look for on your gear, in no particular order:  
-Max Mana%/Flat Mana (Mana% becomes less valuable once you get Primordial Ferocious Affinity)  
-Max Life%/Flat Life

-Mana Leech/Life Leech

-Elemental Damage%  
-Attack Speed

-Melee Recast Chance

-Area Increased Effect

-Damage to Elites%

-Elite Damage Reduction/Projectile Damage Reduction/Area Damage Reduction

-Movespeed

My Attributes are still being flexed around as I need them, so just pay attention to the outlined needs for this build and adjust accordingly. In general, the early Max Mana nodes from Willpower are great pickups and lots of flat Mana from Zeal are good, and as you get more Legendaries the first Greater Trait under Bravery becomes quite powerful too.

Important Stat Notes:

-\*Life Leech doesn’t work on Arcane Bond, and you’re not scaling the damage of your Arcane Breach/Chrono-Punctures, so you will be leeching less than most classes. This necessitates greater investment into the Life Leech stat than normal which can be a bit of a pain.

-Mana Leech DOES seem to work for some reason, or maybe its just that much easier to scale, so get around 3% or 5% of it based on your needs to take care of most of your mana problems. A bit more is never a bad thing though. 

-De-prioritize AoE past a certain point. Since enemies are slowly sucked into the center of the Gravational Force-empowered Breaches, you don’t need TOO much AoE, and Ephemeral Rift or Eternal Breach take care of most of it for you. Still a great stat though.

-\*\*Even though attacking faster and thus proccing Time Manip more is a multiplicative DPS increase, attack speed falls off a certain point and you’re already getting a lot of it from Chrono-Speed, so you won’t want too much of this. Also, be mindful of Ferocious Affinity’s Primordial Malediction and it’s mana-burn effect because it really adds up at high attack speeds.  
  
I can’t stress this enough, you really need some defensive stats, so look for the usual good stuff like stacking HP%, Projectile Damage Reduction, Elite Damage Reduction, and of course All Damage Reduction.

Legendaries

I don’t have many legendaries yet and didn’t use any for the majority of my playtime, but I did luck into this one (Inextricable Waistguard)  
![](/assets/posts/PolyvalentCasterMage/images/image9.png)  
and it’s been really good for reducing oneshots. The biggest drawback is that it’s limited range means Archers still get to chunk you at a distance. Don’t forget to cast Wall of Omen!  
![](/assets/posts/PolyvalentCasterMage/images/image1.png)

This ring (Aestia’s Ring of Life) also became pretty good once I got enough flat Elemental Damage from my Primordial Ferocious Affinity. I’d love to find the matching Ring of Mana to go with. To you players with more normal builds this probably looks like straight garbage, as does the Ring of Mana, but since this build struggles with adequate leeching, they actually have a decent home here. I really like the panic heals when my Wall of Omen is on cooldown and my janky Life on Hit setup isn’t chugging me up fast enough. The Ring of Mana will also be great because we tend to run out of mana in single-target scenarios, as we drastically reduce our leech from Reap What You Sow when facing only a single enemy.

Of course, since most Legendaries have no drawback, please feel free to experiment with any you find and let me know the results. I am sure there are some broken legendaries out there that can take this build to a completely new level. Although I can clear Wrath 10s as-is, my account is still very new so I am sure this build has lots more room to improve once I get as many Legendaries as Legrams as I continue to farm and level my gear.
